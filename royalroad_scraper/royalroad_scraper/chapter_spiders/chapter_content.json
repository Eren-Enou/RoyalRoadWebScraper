He had job security and a steady income, but was bitter and lonely, an example of the average, microscopic cog in the corporate machinery of Serv0tec Inc. He was a gear that spun about aimlessly - not even connected to anything, often getting paid for doing absolutely nothing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">His daily routine was a never-ending labyrinth of pointless business meetings about reallocating priorities, starting projects that never finished due to being reassigned, and pretending to satisfy clients who couldn't be bothered to use google.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">On this particular Wednesday, Dave was feeling particularly disgruntled. He had been stuck in a meeting nearly all morning in which his colleagues discussed the importance of prioritizing tasks</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As if on cue, his manager poked his head into his cubicle. \"Hey, D, could you grab everyone some coffee?\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dave felt a sense of mild irritation wash over him. His office manager's idea of \"office efficiency\" involved wearing two watches for tracking two time zones and shortening everyone's name to a single letter or two. He wondered if he would ever be able to reclaim his full name at this rate. It seemed quite a hopeless endeavor, so he chose not to argue and accepted the quest with a nod.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As Dave stumbled into the elevator, the grating sound of elevator music assaulted his ears. He winced, wishing he had the superpower to control the musical choices of elevators, or perhaps even the universe.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He spotted one of his overly chatty coworkers in the elevator and quickly averted his gaze, pretending to be engrossed in his phone. He knew all too well the agony of being trapped in an eternal loop of small talk with Karen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As the elevator doors opened, Dave bolted out of the building, eager to temporarily escape the blandness of corporate life. He flashed his ID badge at the security desk, feeling a small sense of satisfaction at the semblance of authority it granted him and strode toward the nearest Starbucks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dave had been walking across the street on his way back, trying to balance an absurd amount of coffee cups in his hands, when he heard the screeching of tires and felt the crushing impact of a car.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. . .</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">An otherworldly, ethereal chorus resounded in his mind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As Dave's eyes fluttered open, he saw a blurry figure looming over him, surrounded by a halo of radiant, brilliant light.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"Congratulations!\" a voice boomed in his head, \"You've been reincarnated, hero! Welcome to your new life of adventure, magic, and dragons!\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dave struggled to focus on the figure in front of him. The image flickered and doubled like a film slide layered over itself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With a tremendous effort, Dave managed to mentally focus on one of the images and the double effect suddenly popped like a soap bubble encountering a child's finger. The image of the haloed goddess converged into a paramedic girl in a bloodstained orange vest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"Where are my dragons?\" he slurred.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The paramedic's blue eyes sparkled with amusement. \"Sorry to disappoint you, hero,\" she said, \"but there are no dragons here.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dave's heart sank. He had been hoping for a more exciting afterlife. But as he looked up at the paramedic, he couldn't help but notice how pretty she was. Not in a perfect, ethereal way, but in a human, flawed way. She looked a tad exhausted, with locks of blonde hair escaping from a tightly bound bun, but all the tiredness seemed buried beneath a brilliant, wide smile.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"You've been dead for three and a half minutes. That's a lot of minutes. Probably enough to see dragons. You're welcome, by the way,\" the paramedic stated. \"Consider yourself lucky. It's Wednesday!\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dave couldn't help but roll his eyes. \"What's so lucky about Wednesday?\" he groaned.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"See, statistically fewer people die on a Wednesday, therefore you're in luck to pick this day to get run over by a taxi. Get it? You don't look convinced. You're right! I just made that fact up to cheer you up.\" The paramedic's smile widened. \"I'm Laricianna by the way. Stupid name I know, I didn't pick it. You can call me Lari. Remember to stay positive. Everything from here on is only going to be better! You can't get any worse than being dead, see?\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lari just smiled and went back to her work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As Dave stared up at the ceiling of the ambulance, he couldn't help but feel a sense of bitter irony. He had always wanted more excitement in his life, but he never imagined that it would come in the form of a car accident and a mangled body.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"Well,\" he muttered to himself, \"at least I can say that I died doing what I loved. Drinking coffee and ignoring traffic laws.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lari chortled overhead. Dave wondered if there was something wrong with her, nobody else found his horrible jokes amusing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. . .</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lari or Dave's hallucination, whichever it was, had been spot on - Dave had been reborn. But this wasn't like the kind of rebirth experienced by some new-age yoga enthusiast after a few deep breaths and a green smoothie. This was the kind of rebirth that involved learning how to walk again, talk again, and a series of surgeries that made him feel like a cyborg. The bolts that now held his shattered bones together were a constant reminder of his new reality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dave lost his job at Serv0tec, the one thing that used to give his life some semblance of purpose. He was now stuck with a disability pension, which felt like a slap in the face. He spent most of his free time moping around, feeling sorry for himself, and calling Lari just to hear her voice. She was always there to give him the tough love he needed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"Don't focus on regrets,\" she said. \"Focus on the future. Focus on being productive, on learning new things. You got a new lease on life, don't blow it or you'll disappoint me.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At first, Dave resisted. But as he slowly recovered both mentally and physically, Lari's words began to sink in. He read an article about Google's Lamda project and discovered the \u201cAttention Is All You Need\u201d paper which tickled his interest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Joining an online community of similar enthusiasts, he collaborated with numerous other, more experienced AI programmers to develop on an open source large language model. It wasn't easy at first, but with time and effort, he was making incremental progress understanding a field that was entirely new for him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As he worked on the project, Dave began to feel a sense of purpose again. He was determined to make something of himself despite the setbacks he had faced. His friendship with Lari grew and blossomed, and he found himself looking forward to each new day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. . .</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Six long years had passed, and the code that he had poured his soul into made contributions to the greater goal of making open source AI assistants. Alas, it was a bittersweet success that left him feeling empty inside, due to an unfortunate twist of fate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">On a very dreary October morning, Dave found himself standing in front of Lari's grave. The flowers he had brought with him seemed unable to express the depth of his grief. He finally understood why she had refused to date him, why she had kept him at arm's length. She had been fighting a battle that was bigger than both of them, and in the end, cancer had claimed her life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He looked up at the sky, as if he could somehow find the answer to his pain there, but all he saw was an expanse of gray clouds. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He knelt down in front of the grave, tears streaming down his face, and placed the flowers at the base of the headstone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thunder cracked overhead, a rainstorm rolling across the sky. The rain poured, chasing people away from the cemetery.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dave found himself alone. He fumbled with the keys for a minute before finally managing to start his car. He drove aimlessly, away from the city.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The road was a blur as pouring rain and his tears clouded his vision. He felt the weight of the world crashing down on him, mocking him, taunting him. What was the point of anything if his best friend was no longer there to share it with him?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The road home was far worse than he had anticipated, and the slick pavement snickered beneath his tires as he found himself drifting into the oncoming lane. There, a car loomed, blinding him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dave attempted to swerve out of its path. His new, unforgiving trajectory flung him off the road, through the parapet. His car flew towards a proud and ancient six hundred year old sequoia, who had, over the course of its long life, acquired a certain amount of indifference towards the comings and goings of lesser beings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The tree withstood the vehicular onslaught with the sort of quiet dignity that can only be achieved by spending centuries minding one's own business.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The programmer, on the other hand, found himself decidedly less fortunate in this encounter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. . .</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dave blinked, trying to focus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The sensation of a thousand tiny hammers pummeling his head compounded his misery. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To his astonishment, he was alive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">His ill-fated rendezvous with the sequoia should have rendered him a mere smear on the uncaring forest floor, yet here he was, perfectly unharmed!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dave found himself confronted by an unexpected and mildly alarming sight: an entire ocean of naked people all around him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The crowd was massive, stretching as far as the eye could see. Dave estimated there had to be millions of people here, all equally confused and disoriented. Girls shrieked and covered themselves, while guys muttered and cursed under their breath. The noise was deafening, with millions of voices blending together in a cacophony of confusion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dave felt like a lone fish out of water in a sea of bare bodies. He had never felt so out of place in his life, and he had been to some pretty weird parties at college. He couldn't help but wonder how he ended up here. Was this some sort of sick joke? A twisted version of the afterlife?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He looked beyond the crowd, to the point where the sky should have been. There was no sky.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There was an unnatural, quirky wrongness with perspective, no horizon line to be seen. It was as if the universe had forgotten to install a proper ceiling on this place.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The world curving upwards was a kaleidoscope of colors, a display of wonder that defied comprehension. Cumulonimbus giants loomed overhead, casting their shadows across the gradually curving terrain.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Supercell storms spun menacingly overhead, their dark tendrils snaking across the landscape. Volcanoes belched smoke and ash, their fiery maws a stark contrast against the cool blues and greens. Deep blue oceans shimmered under the scorching sun, tiny waves crashing against cliffs of jagged rock.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Glacier peaks gave way to vast deserts of yellow sand. Azure lakes sparkled like jewels, their waters clear and pristine. Frozen tundra stretched out in patches of white.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The horizon curved up and up, the mountains, lakes and forests becoming mere specks on the landscape as they blended into the endless expanse of the sky, the details eventually getting too distant and too small to be observed with the naked eye. Parts of the landscape looked like they had been bombarded with asteroids, gargantuan circular impacts bisecting mountains and forming new lakes and oceans.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As he stood there, gazing up at the spectacle before him, a sense of insignificance washed over him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dave's mind struggled to comprehend the scale of what he was witnessing. Was this world a hollow sphere? If so, it was astonishingly gigantic. Possibly hundreds of millions of times bigger than the Earth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Like a bolt of lightning, the answer suddenly hit him. This had to be a Dyson sphere, a theoretical, colossal megastructure crafted around a star. It was a world turned inside out, a marvel of engineering that defied imagination.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"Bloody fantastic,\" he sarcastically muttered under his breath as his eyes came back down to the naked, increasingly perturbed crowd. \"I always wanted to be part of a giant nudist colony in the afterlife inside of a god-damn Dyson sphere.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"CONGRATULATIONS!\" a loud, snarky, male voice boomed, causing Dave's eardrums to throb with pain.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"What?\" Dave asked, feeling an unnerving sense of deja vu.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">His comment was drowned out by the roar of the crowd. The ocean of naked, bewildered humanity stirred.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"Your old lives have ended and you have been reincarnated by my divine grace!\" the deafening voice resounded once again, making Dave wince.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The crowd stirred and made incoherent noises of a million people trying to respond.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"SILENCE!\" The voice echoed across the landscape, causing David's teeth to rattle in his skull.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dave rotated and craned his neck to see the source of the voice, and millions of others around him did the same.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A rotund figure of a bald, bearded man draped in cloth woven from gold and black threads, sat against the yellow sky of a distant continental desert. The clouds passed through the figure as if he were a mere hologram. David assumed this was some sort of projection. A suspicious thought crossed his mind that perhaps this ludicrous vision was a hallucination brought on by his car crash.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"I AM THE GOLD DRAGON-GOD-EMPEROR,\" the figure bellowed, clearing his throat. \"I summoned you to this world to aid me in my fight against wretched villains who threaten the prosperity of my nation! Now you have a chance to become heroes and citizens of my glorious Empire. If you do not wish to work for me, raise your right hand and I will free you from such responsibility. Choose. You have one hundred heartbeats to make a decision.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">David blinked, trying to make sense of the situation. The Dragon Emperor's tone was somehow off, and David felt a tingle in the back of his mind, warning him that something was amiss. All around him, people began to raise their hands in defiance. David kept his hand down, his eyes glued to the Emperor's rotund figure sitting on an upside down stone pyramid.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Emperor waited, his eyes flicking over the crowd with amusement. David couldn't help but feel a sense of dread at the thought of working for such a pompous, ridiculous looking figure. He wondered what sort of \"heroes\" the fat Emperor expected them to become.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One hundred heartbeats passed quickly, and Dave hoped that he made the right decision. He looked at the ground beneath his feet. It was made of something white. Dave leaned closer trying to understand the pattern of uneven shapes beneath his feet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"Marvelous. For those of you who didn't raise your hands, observe!\" The Dragon Emperor's eyes flared up as he uttered a single word: \"Isekai!\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of popping, followed by a chorus of screams. Dave turned to look at the old man standing next to him, who had raised his hand in response to the Emperor's question. The man was no longer recognizable as a human being; he had been twisted and fused together with another body, creating a grotesque, surreal abomination. Two mouths were open wide in agony and terror.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dave saw that all of those who had raised their hands suffered the same fate of being juxtaposed with another summoned body. They were choking and gasping for air, their faces turning blue as they collapsed to the ground.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"This is how I deal with useless chaff,\" the Dragon Emperor declared from above. \"Disobey me, and you will be liberated. Serve me well, and you will become part of the team!\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dave was too horrified to pay attention. He suddenly understood the answer to his query as he bent closer to the ground, heaving. He saw that he was standing on a carpet of bones, the remnants of countless genocides that had been compressed and compacted by millions of feet over the years into white sand. How many people had willingly chosen to be \"free\" here before this group?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The hologram of the Dragon Emperor flickered, fading. His voice now boomed from behind. Dave turned and saw a tremendous, white city with the hologram now sitting over it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"March towards my city,\" the Emperor commanded. \"There, you will be given food and weapons! Cheers.\" He offered the naked crowd a seraphic smile, like a monster that had just killed millions with no remorse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"And don't forget,\" the Emperor added, \"you can always choose to be free, to walk away from my city. Go ahead, I'll be watching.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dave felt numb as he began to trudge towards the city with the others. He now knew that anyone who tried to escape would be killed instantly by isekai. The irony of being given a choice to be free when there was no real choice at all was not lost on him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The great yellow-white city loomed on the horizon as Dave and the naked, thinned-out but still massive crowd shambled towards it. With each step, they stepped over and onto the corpses of the millions of the \"liberated\". Dave's unease grew as the walls made from white blocks stretched away from him for miles in every direction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Gigantic white pyramids loomed above the walls, their golden caps glittering in the sunlight. It was a grotesque, ludicrous sight, and Dave couldn't help but gulp at the enormity of it all. He saw distant, tiny people, working away at the walls and the buildings. White walls. White pyramids. White like the ground beneath his feet. Bones.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The city was constructed entirely out of bones. Bones of the people that had been summoned here by the millions, perhaps even billions, after they died on Earth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dave felt a sudden, minute hope blossom in his chest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lari!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Maybe she had been summoned here! Maybe she was alive here, against all odds. She was clever and quick on her feet. Dave searched the faces in the crowd, hoping to see her familiar features, but he didn't recognize anyone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWELCOME TO FORTRESS CITADEL D-114.\" The Dragon Emperor's voice boomed from the sky, welcoming them to his domain.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But as Dave continued to walk towards the city, his unease grew. What if Lari was one of the unlucky ones, summoned into a person? What if he never saw her again? The thought made his heart ache. But he couldn't give up hope. It was the only thing keeping him moving forward.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dave's mind was racing, trying to make sense of the physics-defying world that he found himself in. It was a place where magic seemed to be the norm and giant holograms floated in the sky, summoning absurd numbers of people right into other people, as if it were a perfectly normal activity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Despite the overwhelming strangeness of this world, Dave felt a glimmer of hope. Maybe necromancy was a thing here, or perhaps even time travel. Whatever the case, Dave was determined to bend the rules of this universe to his will. He clung to that sliver of hope like a drowning man clutching a life preserver. He had to find the girl with the perpetually positive attitude and the brilliant smile who had saved his life on a Wednesday.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. . .</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dave felt utterly spent as he stumbled through the gates to the city. The sun beat down mercilessly, casting the world in a fiery glow.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The sprawling citadel loomed right in front of him, a towering behemoth of white blocks that seemed to stretch on forever. Dave couldn't fathom the scope of this place - it was larger than anything he'd ever seen, even in his wildest dreams. The teeming masses of humanity dispersed into a labyrinthine network of gates and entrances, each leading to a different district of the city.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dave found himself in a queue that snaked its way towards a looming entrance marked with bold, imposing letters- \"GATE 76\". The bold, English letters seemed oddly out of place amidst the otherwise absurdly alien surroundings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dave's feet ached, his throat was parched, and he was beyond exhausted. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, he reached the entrance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The massive hall that greeted him was dazzlingly vast, the ceiling soaring high above his head. After another thirty minutes, Dave spotted a counter up ahead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The attendant standing at the counter looked like a cross between a medieval executioner and a horror movie villain. He was talking to every person who had reached his desk with a distinct air of boredom. Dave watched as the attendant handed out black bracelets and white knives to every person, while burly guards in flesh-sewn uniforms roughly ushered the rest of the confused and bewildered humans along the way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"Name?\" The attendant asked Dave with a yawn, his British accent dripping with disdain.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"Dave Wall... Wallsberry,\" Dave decided to fib, his voice trembling slightly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The counter in front of him was made entirely of bones too, Dave realized with a shudder - and the attendant's clothing was sewn from what looked like human skin. The jewelry adorning the man's fingers and neck was made from carved human bones, and a mask fashioned from a human skull sat atop his face.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"Welcome to the Dragon Empire,\" the attendant said, noticing Dave's horrified gaze. \"Everything here is made from people, by people. You're one of us now, Mr. Wallsberry. Welcome to the team.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He handed Dave a black bracelet and instructed him to put it on and say \"CONNECT TO THE SYSTEM\" in a clear voice. Dave complied. As he spoke the words, a blue window appeared on the bracelet, flashing with an eerie light.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dave blinked in surprise at the sight of the holographic window.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"Follow the prompts, get assessed for magical affinity, complete a quest, get a magic skill, etc. It'll all be there,\" the desk attendant explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dave nodded wearily.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"Only you can see your system prompts,\" the skull-masked attendant said. \"They're personal for everyone.\"</span></p>\n<div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[SCANNING SOUL... PLEASE WAIT]</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The blue window blinked.</span></p>\n<div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[SOUL INTEGRATION IN PROGRESS...]</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dave felt a strange, tickling sensation in his chest as the blue window flickered. He wondered what was happening inside him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"Your first mission will be to head back out the gate and carve gold out of the dead,\" the desk attendant added, handing Dave a short bone knife.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dave accepted the knife with a trembling hand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"It's made from compressed human bones. Tougher than regular human bones,\" the man said. \"Bring back one thousand gold tooth crowns. No rules. We only accept strong heroes here.\"</span></p>\n<div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[CITADEL GATE - QUEST: Bring back one thousand gold teeth to gain access to Citadel D-114.]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[Accept: Y/N?]</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The blue window changed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"I'm...\" Dave struggled to find the words.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The desk attendant handed him a belt and a pouch sewn from human skin. \"This is enough food and water for the day.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dave's stomach turned at the sight of the pouch as he had a gnawing suspicion what the food and water was made from.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"Good luck,\" the desk attendant finished, pointing a grimy finger back towards the field of the dead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As Dave turned around and stepped out of the gate, he was hit with a wave of nausea. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He clutched his bone knife tightly, as if it were the only thing anchoring him to reality. He had no idea how to do magic, not even a clue about how to fight. The journey ahead of him seemed impossible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As he surveyed the scene around him, Dave saw that a few of the half-merged people were still alive, but only just, emitting pitiful groans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He saw that other naked people, armed with similar bone knives, were already slicing open the mouths of the dead, or finishing off those who were still clinging to life, in the hopes of finding gold crowns. Some were forming gangs, others were fighting over the precious teeth.

He had died and gone straight to hell.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He retreated back into the gate, the only safe haven in this nightmarish landscape. The guards in skull masks were stationed there. They grabbed anyone who caused trouble, throwing them into a dark pit, moving with inhuman speed and strength. The wails that echoed from the pit were enough to make Dave's blood run cold.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A naked man with a bone knife sticking out of his back rushed past the gate, screaming incoherently. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As Dave stood there, lost in thought, a girl approached the counter.<br></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"I can't do this,\" she said to the desk attendant, her voice trembling. \"It's too dangerous out there.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dave nodded in agreement, but the attendant simply pointed to the dark pit beyond the gate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"You can always choose to be free,\" he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"I see,\" she answered.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dave gulped as he looked down at his very pale, skinny arms, regretting his life choices.

His parents stood frozen at his sides like scarecrows, the blood draining from their faces. Of all the doctors that the 17-year-old Alvis Silva had been to, this had been the first to actually tell him how much time he had left. The truth had been looming above them for so long that its shadow felt like a permanent cloak around Alvis.</p>\n<p>Dimly, he heard his mother start to protest, desperately grasping at straws that didn\u2019t exist. None of her words registered in Alvis\u2019 mind. It had gone as blank as the hospital room\u2019s walls, the doctor\u2019s words ringing through it like the toll of a church bell. And then, finally, the corner of Alvis\u2019 lips quirked up in the faintest hint of a smile.</p>\n<p><em>About damn time!</em></p>\n<p>After the dots had connected, Alvis had a hard time hiding his smile. His body shook not out of fear but out of excitement! He did not want to let it show, but this was the first time in a long that he was happy.</p>\n<p>Finally, he could die.</p>\n<p>There was no better thing he could have heard today!</p>\n<p>Of course, his parents who were next to him could not believe it. They did not want to believe it.</p>\n<p>This was understandable.</p>\n<p>Alvis was their one and only child. His mom broke out into tears and his dad had to embrace her.</p>\n<p>Alvis averted his gaze, looking at the ground awkwardly. He could not bear this sight.</p>\n<p>His parents knew that this day would come sooner or later, yet they were always there for him. He did not take their love for granted, he really appreciated them for it. Not every parent would raise a cursed child. Being a cursed child, it was a miracle that he even lived this long, although his life contained nothing but pain. <em>Well, almost nothing.</em></p>\n<p>If it was not for his parents, Alvis would have already killed himself.</p>\n<p>However, Alvis did not see himself as suicidal.</p>\n<p>Yet he would not hesitate to throw himself before a truck to save a little cat.</p>\n<p>That was a small but subtle difference.</p>\n<p>He just did not see a reason to live.</p>\n<p>Why should he, if all that awaited him was pain?</p>\n<p>Being dead was a way better option than living in pain. That was what he thought. But of course, he could not let this show.</p>\n<p>His mom was still crying and shouting, while his dad did his best to calm her down. Alvis just sat there and said nothing. He tried his best to look sad but also not too sad so he wouldn\u2019t worry his parents. Maintaining this perfect balance, he just waited for the doctor to continue.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike you all are well aware of, Alvis has a rare illness. Having mana inside him, albeit being a human, already decided his fate as a child. There is nothing we can do about it. The medicine he took all his life long was the only reason he survived this long. But no medicine is all-powerful. Even with our modern technology and our magic capabilities, we still haven\u2018t found a way to cure his illness. We are sincerely sorry. Please enjoy the limited time you have left with your son to the fullest.\u201c</p>\n<p>Alvis knew that the doctors\u2019 words were honest ones, so he did not blame him. The Alvis some time ago might have, but he had grown up now. He simply accepted his fate. Fighting his destiny was way too exhausting for him.</p>\n<p>But now that his death day was set in stone, Alvis did not know what to do. He thought about the things he always wanted to do but never had the chance to do. However, nothing came to his mind. Alvis did not have dreams or something like that. The biggest wish he always had was to be normal, yet this was a dream that would never come true. Besides that, all he could think of was how his pain would become less. In his life, there was no place for dreams.</p>\n<p>He decided to think about that later. For now, he would focus his time on his family. His mom was still crying and even his dad shed some tears.</p>\n<p>Watching his parents cry, something inside Alvis twitched.</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t rationally explain it, yet he felt it deep inside him. Even if he himself came to terms with his death, he couldn\u2019t bear watching his parents cry because of him. It was a feeling of guilt that Alvis thought he had already left behind. Alvis\u2019 hand trembled, and he bit his tongue so he could suppress this weird feeling. He did not want to feel this way. He did not want to regret anything. But watching his parents cry like this, Alvis just couldn\u2019t help but wonder, <em>is there no way for me to live?</em></p>\n<p>He hated himself for even thinking that. There was no way for him to live, and he knew it. Accepting his fate and dying would be the way better choice.</p>\n<p>Heck, he even wanted to die.</p>\n<p>That was why he couldn\u2019t explain this weird feeling. It did not make sense.</p>\n<p>Alvis hated it.</p>\n<p>That was why he always ignored this feeling when it came up. He did not want to have hope. All he wanted was for this pain to end.</p>\n<p>Again, Alvis closed off all his feelings. He did not need them.</p>\n<p>He embraced his parents and did not say a word. Silently, he just hugged his crying parents without shedding a tear. All he wanted was to thank them. For Alvis, the only good in this world was his parents. If he was going to miss something when he died, it would be them. With shaking lips, Alvis mentally apologized to them for being born cursed.</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Some time passed, and they all calmed down a bit.</p>\n<p>They couldn\u2019t stay in the doctor\u2019s room forever, so they had to leave. Alvis\u2019 mom was still sobbing, so Alvis lent her his hand. Feeling his warmth, she controlled herself again. Alvis\u2019 mother was a strong woman. She knew that this day would come, so she now tried her best to enjoy the last bit of time with her son.</p>\n<p>Walking out of the hospital with his family, Alvis started thinking about his life. He usually hated thinking about his life, but with his death awaiting him soon, reviewing his life once more would be okay.</p>\n<p>Being born with mana as a human already decided his fate as a child.</p>\n<p>His white hair was a sign of it.</p>\n<p>Even now he could see the people watching over him in disgust, even though he wore a cap.</p>\n<p>He got used to those looks. Since his childhood, they had labeled him as the child of the devil. Because only the devil possessed white hair.</p>\n<p>Alvis did not know the devil, nor had he had an active connection with him. As a practicing Arifuner, being associated with the devil was the last thing he wanted. Besides, the Devil was sealed away long ago, so there was not even a way for Alvis to have a connection to him.</p>\n<p>Still, he knew he was cursed. But knowing that did not change the fact that he never knew what he had done wrong. He always hated himself for being born with such a terrible fate, yet he couldn\u2019t change it. This was why he gave up.</p>\n<p><em>There is nothing I can do about it.</em></p>\n<p>Suddenly, he felt something. Even though he took his medicine in the morning, he could feel how the mana inside him was about to act up. His whole body started burning from the inside and the all too familiar pain struck him. Just walking took a huge toll on his body and he could not walk straight anymore. Maintaining his cool demeanor did not work, and he fell to the ground.</p>\n<p>The doctor was right, there was no way for him to survive more than two months now.</p>\n<p>Instantly, his dad and mom picked him up. For them, it was nothing new, yet their eyes always widened in horror when they saw it.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you alright, Alvis? Do you need your medicine?\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cI-I am good,\u201c Alvis said before grasping her outstretched hand. \u201cThanks, Mom.\u201c</p>\n<p>Supported by his parents, he stood up again. He could not worry his parents anymore. He had to be strong. Alvis suppressed all the pain and managed a sincere smile.</p>\n<p>They continued walking and soon arrived home. Alvis and his family lived in a house in a remote neighborhood containing mainly humans. It was peaceful, and nothing really happened there.</p>\n<p>However, today Alvis had an odd feeling.</p>\n<p>It felt like it was <em>too </em>quiet.</p>\n<p>But Alvis was not someone who would listen to something as irrational as a gut feeling. So they entered their home.</p>\n<p>However, the first thing he saw was a man sitting on their stairs.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you are finally here. It took you long enough!\u201c</p>\n<p>Arriving home, someone unexpectedly greeted them. It was a man wearing a full red suit and a red hat. He had pale white skin and blond hair, also his ears were pointed to the sky. Alvis knew that this man was either an elf or a vampire. But what the hell was he doing in their home?</p>\n<p>Alvis\u2019 heart started racing as he theorized about this man. His body froze on the spot and he did not dare to make a move. Alvis and his family were way too shocked to do something. All they did was watch this strange man. However, after a few seconds, it clicked.</p>\n<p><em>A stranger invaded our house!</em></p>\n<p>\u201cWho the hell are you? Get out of my house, now!\u201c</p>\n<p>Alvis\u2019 father was the first to speak up. He took one step forward, letting Alvis only see his wide back. His tone was serious, and he clenched his fist, preparing for a fight.</p>\n<p>Alvis\u2019 father did not wince before the strange man. He thought he was a thief that wanted to rob them. Even if it came to a fight, he was confident of beating him.</p>\n<p>Yet Alvis could not ease up.</p>\n<p>He knew that this man was not a normal one!</p>\n<p>It was not because he was an elf or vampire; it was because Alvis could feel the malice in him! The weird feeling he had before certainly came because of him.</p>\n<p>Looking the man in the eyes, cold sweat overcame Alvis. He instinctively took a step back. Alvis\u2019 body started shaking, while every cell in his body told him to run away. His rational mind commanded him to do it!</p>\n<p>It was the first time since long that Alvis was afraid.</p>\n<p>Call it motherly instinct, but his mom immediately took Alvis\u2019 hand and positioned herself in between the man and her son. The man only watched while this was happening, not leaving his intense glare on Alvis even once.</p>\n<p>It was when Alvis felt the love of his mom that he knew what he was so afraid of. It was not his own life he cared about; it was the life of his parents. He could not let his parents die!</p>\n<p>He knew it.</p>\n<p>This man was out for blood! He wasn\u2019t a normal thief!</p>\n<p>\u201cGet out of my house now! I won\u2018t repeat myself!\u201c</p>\n<p>The man in red just looked at Alvis\u2019 dad, annoyance building up within him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSilence!\u201c</p>\n<p>A shiver run down Alvis\u2019 spine as the man uttered those words. The mana inside him seethed, sending him clear signs.</p>\n<p><em>DANGER!</em></p>\n<p>\u201cDad! Watch out!\u201c</p>\n<p>It happened way too fast. The man just hold his hand out and a beam gun appeared. The next moment, a laser beam shot straight through the chest of Alvis\u2019 dad. Dead, he fell face forward to the ground. His blood covered the passage in a dark red.</p>\n<p>Alvis just watched as this was happening. Time seemed like it was freezing. All he could do was watch his dad lying on the floor. Alvis was smart, yet at this moment his brain was overwhelmed. It took him a few seconds to process it.</p>\n<p><em>My father is dead.</em></p>\n<p>Alvis\u2019 heart started raising while his body trembled. He could not see clearly anymore as he tried his best to fight against the dizziness that overcame him. Yet his eyes were glued to his father\u2019s corpse.</p>\n<p>It could not be true.</p>\n<p>His mind spun, trying to rationalize this situation. Yet Alvis did not understand what was happening. All kinds of different emotions overflowed him. But in the end rage took over!</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What did you do to my dad?!\u201c</em></p>\n<p>He could not hold in his emotions anymore. Crying, he raised his voice. Alvis normally was not a person who would shout or even let his emotions get the best of him. However, this situation was different. All he wanted was for his dad to just stand up again. He could not accept him just dying like that. The man that raised him, his hero! He couldn\u2018t just die!</p>\n<p>\u201cStop crying,\u201c the man said aiming his gun at Alvis. \u201cYou will follow him soon!\u201c</p>\n<p>He shot once more. But Alvis was not the one who got hit. Another person jumped in between. She caught the beam so Alvis wouldn\u2018t die. The person saved Alvis\u2019 life by sacrificing her own.</p>\n<p>It was his mom.</p>\n<p>Dead, she fell straight into his arms.</p>\n<p>Alvis couldn\u2019t react.</p>\n<p>All he could do was feel how his mother\u2019s body got colder and colder. Her blood painted his clothes in a similar color to the clothes her killer wore. Watching his mother die in his arms, something inside of him snapped.</p>\n<p>Alvis never had a stable psyche. His whole life was a disaster. From the moment he was born, the entire world was against him. Only his parents were there for him. They were the only mental support he had. This was the only reason he could endure all this pain.</p>\n<p>But now they were gone.</p>\n<p>It was as if all the pain he had to endure was not enough. The world had to take his parents, too. He would have died soon, yet his remaining time on earth couldn\u2019t even be a bit peaceful. Once again, he was remembered that he was <em>cursed!</em></p>\n<p>He did not understand it.</p>\n<p>Why? Why him? Why his parents? All he wished for was for them to be happy. They did not deserve to die. He was the one who should die, but not them. Why was the world like that?</p>\n<p>He could not take it anymore.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will fucking kill you!\u201c</p>\n<p>Alvis lost it all. He broke down in tears. Holding his mother\u2019s corpse, he stared at her killer with unmeasurable hatred. All the hate he built up in his life was concentrated on him. Alvis did not know how to fight or something like that, but one thing was certain for him.</p>\n<p>He would kill him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou truly are the child of the devil!\u201c</p>\n<p>But life was cruel. There was no way for Alvis to kill this man now. The man in red just aimed his gun at Alvis\u2019 head, and it was over in an instant.</p>\n<p>Alvis died.</p>\n<p>[YOU DIED!]</p>\n<p>[SYSTEM UNLOCKED!]</p>\n<p>[GAME START!]</p>\n            </div>",

I tried very hard to be one, but unfortunately I lived in a very turbulent time, a time of change, progress and most of all - death. I was a firm believer in humanism, in improving and saving the world. I believed the books of my childhood which told me stories of great engineering feats, of conquering the wilds, sailing the sky and reshaping seas. I was an idealist and lived for a goal, a dream - the improvement of life for all humanity. It was a dream which had shattered as those in power had betrayed us.</p>\n<p>Our leaders did not follow the propaganda they had instilled in the hearts and minds of children and USSR citizens like myself. They spoke of bringing peace to the world while they ordered the construction of fifty thousand nuclear warheads. How many people could those warheads have fed? How many beautiful roads, hospitals and schools could that money have built?</p>\n<p>But, I cannot blame the Soviet government for everything. Perhaps the dream we were following was flawed to begin with. The very tenets of Bolshevism called for the deaths of anyone who opposed it and the millions of lives that it took to lay the foundation of USSR during the six-year-long Civil War had haunted our supernation until its very end.</p>\n<p>I myself am to blame. Without realizing it, one doctorate after another, one success in the field of biochemistry and virology after the other and I became the administrator of Aralsk-7, a top secret Soviet facility that worked to wield death itself.</p>\n<p>Without intending to do so, I became a tiny gear in the machinery of war that I had once dreamt of preventing. By the orders of those above me, I ended up working on Vozrozhdeniya island war base, managing the design of new biological weapons. Many scientists like myself, the brightest stars raised by USSR, had been caught in the trap of the living manifestation that was our Union. We were all trapped in a beautiful lie, a paradox, where we bred death while propaganda posters around us declared \u201cWorkers of the world unite to bring peace to all mankind\u201d. At the end, none of us could honestly tell each other why we did what we did.</p>\n<p>I looked out of the window of my lab towards the dying Aral sea. Rusted, derelict ships stuck out from the desert that was once the sea floor. <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/918285780353433612/918293420760526928/D-_--TECHNOMAGICA_shhsssp3.jpg\"><br><br>In 1960 we had diverted the local rivers to irrigate the fields of Kazakhstan, and everything around Vozrozhdeniya island slowly dried up and became a dead zone of salt and desert, causing massive sand storms around the area. The newspapers of the 90\u2019s called it \u201cone of the planet's worst environmental disasters\u201d. They weren\u2019t wrong.</p>\n<p>I found it ironic how the lab that produced death was located on an island in a sea we had foolishly killed. Even more so, the Russian name for the island - \u201cVozrozhdeniya\u201d meant \"Rebirth\" and it was anything but!</p>\n<p>\"I'm broadcasting this last message from the central radio tower of Aralsk-7 to anyone willing to listen because I have nothing left and nothing to be afraid of.</p>\n<p>\"Perhaps some will hail me as a hero. Know this, people like me deserve no accolades - I am only correcting my terrible mistakes, narrating my final chapter.</p>\n<p>\"In harnessing the power of the atom the Soviets had caused the Chernobyl catastrophe - the worst nuclear disaster in the world. The explosion of the 4th reactor of Chernobyl made a 2600 km\u00b2 exclusion zone in Ukraine and spread a cloud of radiation as far as Scotland. That was in 1986.</p>\n<p>\"It is now 1992 and something just as horrific is likely to happen, unless I stand my ground. Unless I do what has to be done to destroy my legacy.\"</p>\n<p>I lowered the microphone and looked at the fading, cracked mosaic of Yuri Gagarin, the first man we had put in space. Yuri stared down at me from the wall of the Viral Research Laboratory, his hand raised to the sky as if he was trying to capture the heavens themselves. The symbol of USSR, the renowned hammer and sickle, was embedded into the cracked, hexagonal mosaic with gold-plated tiles. It shone above Yuri as if it was the core of a nuclear reactor that was attempting to irradiate the entire world with divine blessings of the glorious tenets of communism.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/918285780353433612/918287577725931530/kosmonavt---panno.jpg\"></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Yuri. We have failed you,\u201d I spoke, my voice cracking. My finger shook on the trigger of the flare gun pointing at numerous burlap sacks beneath my feet.</p>\n<p>The Bioweapons laboratory was now empty of people. Its halls which were once filled with doctors, assistants and various personnel were now barren. The Soviet Union had fallen and its greatest achievements and accolades meant nothing now. Various shiny medals I had received from numerous General Secretaries of the time meant nothing. My bank account was practically nullified as the Soviet Ruble plummeted. Just last week I saw soldiers carrying millions of Rubles to be buried in a mine shaft nearby and that\u2019s when I knew that it was all over. Millions! Now worth less than the paper they were printed on.</p>\n<p>One of the soldiers gave me a bag full of money from the truck as a \u201cparting souvenir\u201d. The plastic bag with one hundred thousand rubles now sat in the corner, taunting me. I looked at it and remembered how my mother struggled to save fifty rubles in a glass jar in 1950 to buy us something nice. It was heartbreaking.</p>\n<p>I had acquired the fertilizer that now sat beneath my feet from a farm supply depot located on the mainland. It only took a small bribe of several bottles of vodka to the guards and a promise to share the profits from the under-the-table sale. The local administrator had let me relocate their entire stock. I wasn't the first - the desperate and corrupt were already taking apart the Soviet legacy. Simply enough - nobody wanted to deal with 2000 tons of this stuff.</p>\n<p>I had no plans to sell the fertilizer. I tricked the depot administrator to make my last stand. It took a lot of effort on my part to get the bags here - thankfully the army had abandoned tonnes of fuel and equipment when they left.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoctor Kerenski! Give us the keys!\u201d A bald man in a black coat growled at me from behind the barricade of fertilizer bags. I shook my head, refusing to budge. He knew my name because he was a local gangster and marauder aiming to make profit from my dangerous work. The marauder gave a sign to his men. They rushed into the building, breaking down the doors, trying to shove aside numerous fertilizer bags.</p>\n<p>Behind me, beneath the mosaic of the first cosmonaut, were shelves upon shelves of research papers and fridges containing the first living machines the universe itself had crafted over millennia - viruses and bacteria. Labels made in my handwriting announced their names, feared by many: anthrax, smallpox, black plague, brucellosis, tularemia, coronavirus and many, many other RNA viruses and bacteria that we had studied, modified and improved ourselves. Computer databases hummed off to the side, containing bacteriological and virulent research data gathered nearly over half a century by the team that was working under me.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, the captain went down with the ship. I was the metaphorical captain of Aralsk-7, the last guardian of its no longer beating heart - the Bioweapons lab. Throughout the last week 1500 people who lived on Vozrozhdeniya island and worked in Aralsk-7 were rapidly evacuated by the army. Civil and military infrastructure became abandoned and the secret Soviet installation became a ghost town.</p>\n<p>I refused to leave, refused to abandon my post. The soldiers didn\u2019t care enough to drag me out of the lab - they knew that the currency they were getting paid in was now obsolete. They knew that the people in charge had given up on this place. There was no proper procedure, no clear order to decommission the facility, everything was simply to be abandoned, left behind. Kazakhstan had broken away from USSR on December 16, 1991. Whatever had remained belonged to them now. The facility along with all of its containers of death was theirs, according to the barely stable, newly minted, democratic Russian government.</p>\n<p>Two hundred tons of anthrax plus other far more abominable things held within the base were declared Kazakhstan\u2019s problem! Kazakhstan had no way of dealing with the microscopic nightmares held within this place. Its breakaway from USSR and collapse of demand for heavy industry products resulted in a terrible shock for their economy. Anarchy and chaos escalated with every passing day with no end in sight.</p>\n<p>Kazakhstan would do nothing about protecting or destroying this place, I knew. The carelessness of the post-Soviet government was insane, but such was the norm these days. The empire that we had toiled so hard to build had fallen and all of the people who once worked here creating death had left this place forever, abandoning everything.</p>\n<p>Dangerous-looking men in black balaclavas had arrived on a hovercraft just a week after the soldiers had departed. Damned scavengers! I knew that they were looking to raid the labs.</p>\n<p>The blueprints of death behind me could be worth a lot in the right hands - if the gangsters were connected enough they could sell them to the Chinese or Americans to be unleashed in some distant future. Alternatively, if the marauders were stupid and careless, they could get infected and spread death and misery across the entire planet.</p>\n<p>I would not let my work be released upon humanity! Aralsk-7 would not become another Chernobyl. As they rushed towards me, I let go of the trigger and the flare gun fired into the ground igniting the fuel oil that I had poured all over the fertilizer bags. An open oxygen tank hissed at my feet.

The kind of horror that one felt when seeing a monster that shouldn't exist. Even though it was strongly diluted by our link, I could still feel my creator\u2019s heart palpitate with it, transmitting it over to me. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This fear had to be caused by the strange creatures surrounding my creator, these monsters were scaring them. Yet as I took my first tentative steps forward the feeling of fear intensified greatly. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">My creator wasn't scared of those strange beings, they were terrified of me. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This depressing realisation halted me, rooting me in place as I desperately thought of a way to reassure them. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">After a short while of fanatical thinking, I came up with a solution. Me and my creator were bound together, we were two bodies and one soul. This link wasn\u2019t just a one way street, I can communicate back.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So hurriedly I began pushing these new feelings of joy and elation of discovering a solution through our link and was met with failure almost immediately as my creator collapsed.  </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">They were incapacitated and I was to blame, I had hurt my own creator. I had no time to wallow in anguish though as the abominations began to brutalise my creator, tugging at their fragile form and striking them in their centre of mass, no doubt trying to crush all their precious organs. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This wouldn\u2019t stand.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This wouldn\u2019t go unpunished.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With no pangs of external fear to stray me from the path of blood, I begin my charge.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Hurling myself forwards towards them and if I had the oratory appendage capable of it, I would be screaming at them as well. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In just a few seconds I was amongst the horde and butchering them.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For such bold creatures, they surprisingly seemed to have nothing to support their grotesque actions. I wasn\u2019t exactly sending them flying with one blow but I also wasn\u2019t really under a lot of pressure.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The monsters just screeched at me for the most part and threw themselves upon the ground, maybe they were trying to camouflage themselves?</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A few of them did hurl themselves at me though, but I quickly slapped them down and crushed their centre of mass. Ending their lives easily.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I quickly dealt with the rest soon after. Slamming them into the rough sand and tearing apart their tentacles. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Almost all of them spat red fluids onto me, a venom based attack? If so it wasn\u2019t very effective since I didn\u2019t suffer any ill effects. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I tried to avoid killing them, just limiting myself to tearing off their tentacles and incapacitating them.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I was a newborn, after all. I didn\u2019t want to make any mistakes. What if I was accidentally killing my creator's food source? </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At least this way most of them would survive and regrow their lost appendages. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That's what starfish did and these creatures appeared similar to them, though hideously mutated. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In any case, it didn\u2019t matter, I had done my duty, I had protected my creator.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Though just as this sense of fulfilment started to surge through me I heard a piercing shriek that cut through the heavy air like a swordfish through a school of tuna. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There were more of these creatures out there, maybe not just a pack but a whole school of them. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">My unconscious creator and I were hidden behind a large sand dune, so we should be safe from whatever these things were.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But that did nothing to ease my discomfort. I was a predator yes but not an Apex one. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There were still things that fed on me, though now that I started thinking about it, I couldn\u2019t recall what it was that hunted me.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Perhaps when my creator awoke I would get my answers, they were wise after all. They had to be. Otherwise, how could I have been created? </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This wasn\u2019t the time for pondering upon my existence though, for the more attention I paid to my surroundings, the more screeches I heard. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">They seemed to mostly come from over the dune so at least we weren\u2019t surrounded, but that was hardly comforting. For the sheer volume of the screeches numbered in the dozens.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It would be unwise to get into a fight with them, even if I had killed these ones easily enough, what if they were just the runts?</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And so, I kept watch over my surroundings, carefully protecting my creator from any threats.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And after a few minutes of vigilantly standing guard over my creator's fallen form, they stirred awake. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As they slowly rose up into an upright position feelings of bewilderment and confusion made their way through the link.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I thought to respond but I didn\u2019t want to mess up and make them panic again, so I just stayed quiet. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Though it didn\u2019t matter because after just a few seconds those feelings were replaced by the same primal type of fear again.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Then my creator squished two of their odd tentacles against their deformed one in some sort of pondering stance and began to let out a series of loud breaths before starting to tremble.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Perhaps to stimulate their mind?</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While my creator was pondering some exceptionally difficult solutions, I carefully watched them, trying to figure out how to best help them. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">My assistance wasn\u2019t needed though as my creator rather quickly came up with a solution to whatever it was they were so entrenched in thought about.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Standing up, they carefully started walking up the sand dune. I trailed behind them, eager to see what it was my creator was going to do and also to keep them safe. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And then after clambering our way up to the top of the dune, we saw quite the sight. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Those eccentric abominations were prancing around and slapping each other with these pieces of coral, no swords were what they were called. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Once an abomination was hit it would collapse and spurt out doves of this weird red liquid. Poison perhaps? I didn\u2019t want to have to consider the other option.  </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There must be some few hundred of them, though most of them were sleeping or tied up. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For a few dreadful moments that felt like years, I wondered if I had accidentally engaged in some twisted mating practice or despicable ritual. Now that I thought about it, this wasn\u2019t actually so different compared to the practices I knew of.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thankfully my creator put an end to these horrible ideas that were starting to swirl around in my head by saying something.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I couldn\u2019t understand what they said audibly but I didn\u2019t need to. The link made up for this inadequacy. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWar\u201d was what they had uneasily murmured. Never had I felt so relieved over something my creator said, granted this was the first time in my short life that I had heard them speak but I was still overcome by joy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Before I could celebrate though they spoke again and this time they gave orders, not an explanation. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cMy Eclipsian, exterminate those whom wield swords and are clad in cloaks, spare the rest.\u201d </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I actually had quite a bit of difficulty piecing together these orders as they were overshadowed by the omnipresent fear that still echoed through our link. They were also issued incredibly unconfidently which made understanding what I was meant to do even more difficult. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So I didn\u2019t completely understand what I was meant to do, or why I was meant to do it. Nevertheless I understood enough, my creator wanted these things purged. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And so, without any hesitation, once I had properly understood what was expected of me, I started to rush down the dune. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The battle was occurring a few hundred feet away but I was rapidly getting closer. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I could cover dozens of feet in seconds, so in no time at all I was on the outskirts of the battlefield. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It was strange, I couldn\u2019t figure out what feet were despite racking my memory but I knew that was how far away the battle was. Feet weren\u2019t the only thing that confused me either. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I had an innumerable amount of these strange words and ideas floating around in my head. Perhaps when I completed my orders and made my creator proud they would tell me what was going on. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Even as I neared one of the abominations, they still didn\u2019t notice me</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And then just as I was about to spring upon them, it hit me. These weren\u2019t monsters or abominations. They were scavengers not actually predators.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Otherwise why were they so weak. Though it still didn\u2019t quite make sense as to how they were all still alive. They couldn\u2019t even properly observe their environment. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I practically had this one wrapped up in my tendrils and tentacles and it still hadn\u2019t noticed me. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Maybe it was the swords that gave them the ability to survive. I could faintly remember something about how a knight could kill dozens of soldiers with one.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Maybe these creatures were baby knights or they had just scavenged the weaponry off of a corpse. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Oh well, no point in worrying about it.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I had a job to do.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Grabbing hold of their left ridged tentacle I yanked them off balance and towards my wide open maw. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">They turned around to try and face me but all it meant was that they went face first into my mouth.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">They only got to let out a brief shriek before I crunched down on them, silencing the scavenger forever. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Perhaps it was a bad idea but I was pretty sure the poison wouldn\u2019t be that bad and I was feeling rather peckish.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tearing into the supple and weak flesh of my deceased foe was far more difficult than I expected. For some reason, they had these weird sticks inside of them that made it difficult to chew. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">They weren\u2019t inedible but it was quite annoying to have to break them into little pieces before slurping down the creature's remains. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What was even more annoying was that I wasn\u2019t able to see thanks to my gluttony. All the gore obscured my vision, thankfully my eye is shielded by a very thick membrane so it didn\u2019t get irritated or hurt by all the sustenance I was consuming. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The scavenger turned meal also somehow tasted disgusting despite me not having any tastebuds.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How does that even happen?</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It wasn\u2019t even nutrition, as I swallowed down the flesh my hunger still remained unsatiated. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">No wonder this species was still alive, they were just too foul to eat. Perhaps it was a dumb thing to waste my first vow on but I promised myself then and there that I would never eat another scavenger. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Worst of all though, was the fact that the crunching sound the sticks made when they broke had alerted the rest of the scavenger's pack. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Hurriedly I wiped the last of the gore off my eye with my tongues and prepared myself as a score of scavengers started sprinting towards me. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I briefly considered just moving backwards a bit and then flanking them since they had only heard the screams and crunching but hadn't actually spotted me yet but then a hurled torch was hastily thrown in my direction which helped expose me further to the horde of scavengers and ruined any chance of withdrawing unhindered. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Not that it mattered, they were scavengers, not predators, these pathetic creatures were probably the soldiers that knights preyed on. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And now they were my prey too. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And so I started to rush forwards to meet their charge. Confidence fueled my tendrils and tentacles as I prepared to mince them up. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 3em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And promptly I encountered my first failure, as the scavengers dodged my initial barrage of appendages and severed a fair few of them with a dexterity I had previously thought them incapable of. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 4em\">\u00a0</p>\n            </div>",

Blinking several times, he realized the dorm was shrouded in darkness, and as usual, he couldn't see a thing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Though it had been six months since he accepted an invitation to raid the Fortress of Dungeons, Nox doubted he would ever get used to living with the harsh schedules.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He ruffled his chin-length white-silver hair as he got up from the comfy bed in the center of the dorm. Nox sighed. Despite being in this place for six months, he had only passed the tutorial and the F-rank dungeons.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Only a few months ago, he had been surrounded by his room's walls, doing nothing but listening to television sounds all day about famous hunters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But now, this blind young man was greeted with the notification of the next dungeon raid. Even though it had only been twelve hours of sleep for his previous raid.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Still, half-asleep, he began his daily morning exercise. A few moments later, after he completed 100 push-ups, Sit-ups, squats, and jumps, a handful of sweat seeped down from his body, making him feel more relaxed and freshened out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Surviving in such a world wasn't without its risks. High stakes, high gain Those factors were tough on his first two months here; he almost nearly died and barely succeeded in taking on the E-rank dungeon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nox guessed he had started to get the hang of it. As if seething, grey vapor gushed out of his body as a rush of colorful gleam embraced him, relieving fatigue and physical constraints.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As a result, his body stroked him a little. Speaking of which, Healing in the dorm always is practical in these cases. It could barely be called healing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nox put that to the test a few months ago by slicing off a bit of his flesh. To his surprise, the spilled blood reversed back into his wound before closing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In conclusion, that effect is either restoration or instant regeneration. Those supernatural features were passive advantages that allowed Nox to train more efficiently.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">{Fortress Points remaining: 2}</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He clicked his tongue at the little announcement that stung his mind as he purchased his breakfast. A dry strip of meat, Loaves, and Water Mushak. Despite their common necessity for human survival, they're on the pricey side in the fortress of Dungeons.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At five points per strip, it was the most expensive use of his points, yet he had no choice but to survive on it. After all, they're the best choices at the moment. Anything beyond that is an ineffective use of fortress currency.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nox placed a dry strip of meat in his mouth. Hard and tasty, he toiled through them bit by bit and jerked off the lid of Mushak. He keenly gulped up the water.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As soon as all his daily rituals were complete, the fortress system tickled his ears.</span></p>\n<p><strong>The E-rank dungeon raid starts in 9 seconds.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>8\u2026 7\u2026 6\u2026</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In quick succession, Nox tied the black blindfold around his eyes, tied his long white-sliver hair into a ponytail, and activated the blindfold sixth sense skill.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">{Gear Skill 'Sixth Sense' has been activated.}</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">{The sixth sense is connected to Walker's eyes. Thus, the host is still blind. The walker could perceive the surrounding magic and soundwaves to see a full 360 degrees around them without leaving a single blind spot.}</span></p>\n<p><strong>3\u2026 2\u2026 1\u2026</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As the clock counted down, anticipation hazed his mind as he nervously clenched his fists, awaiting what came next.</span></p>\n<p><strong>The raid starts in -0 secs. Break over!</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When the time ran out, the break was over. \u201cNext Dungeon Raid.\u201d Immediately, Nox uttered the command.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Do you enter the E-rank dungeon?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Yes/No.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Without hesitation, he selected \u201cYes\u201d. From nothingness, a teleportation portal emerged.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nox could now see the concept and invisible shockwave patterns, compared to the darkness that once filled his vision.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Not only could he observe the contours of non-animate and invigorated things in heterochromatic hue, leaving the surreal frequencies to his ears, but Nox also strode into the portal, which enfolded his body.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Entering the dungeon.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u2018Walkers\u2019 should now prepare themselves for the boss\u2019s encounter.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">His surroundings had veered toward a cozy passageway.</span></p>\n<p><strong>The E-rank raid is starting now.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The following objective aims to defeat the boss monster\u2019. We wish the \u2018Walker\u2019 happiness in their choice.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The E-rank dungeon raid success reward: Gluttony skill.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The E-rank dungeon raid fails penalty: Death.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cFuck, I can never get used to this\u2026 So I will risk my life for a Gluttony skill. Not bad.\u201d Nox pondered aloud.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A smile formed on his face soon after. It was a good skill to risk his life for. The power to devour and consume anything as per Nox's knowledge as a Low-rank hunter. His body slightly twitched at this new opportunity.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Starting the E-rank dungeon theme.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nox figured that the new dark passage was a place without sound, yet he focused attentively to analyze the darkness. He could see the oscillation patterns swatting about.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">His ears could hear the slight reverberation that howled deepest and blackest down to the earth's crust, mumbling and jumbling, creating a massively disrupted, ripping tempo.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Concluding that his premonition was wrong and his new visualization seemed correct.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nox considered that this place he was now in was different from the previous dungeon he faced. Could it be a random horror Dungeon? Hell, could anyone even call this place a horror Dungeon?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It was rather a hideous, empty passageway crammed with fragments of broken crystals and equipment, and a mildewed smell of dust and rusty, sour iron plugged the air.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Moving further along, a few pieces of scenery begin to reveal themselves. With dried gore and flesh, it seems other Walkers had passed through these Dungeons as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A few disfigured flesh pieces hung precariously, struck with different weapons. It was a remarkable atrocity scene, yet what made it more strange was the pitch darkness, akin to twilight.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A vast and spacious but synthetic world that even his Blindfold gear skill couldn't visualize what lay beyond.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nox figured there was a possibility that what lay beyond was a boss monster. To be certain, he wanted to explore what lay beyond the darkness.</span></p>\n<p><strong>The Goblin King is appearing!</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">His fulfillment couldn't be achieved, as what lies beyond has decided to come to him first.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cKIEEEEKKK\u2026!\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A grand shout reverberated through the passageway as the impact was enough to bleed his eardrum out. Without giving him time to be stunned, the whole floor quaked as, beyond the darkest, an unsightly entity emerged.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It was nearly ten feet tall, with short brown hair and beaked eyes brimming with savagery. Despite drooling with gore and flesh, it was grey all over and was grotesquely sauntering on two hefty feet, causing a big rumble. That monster was holding a giant axe in its right hand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">His giant silhouette, surged with mana, Nox's vision.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cKieeeekkk\u2026!\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Menacingly, the monster shrieked, brimming forth its discretion and startling Nox's heart. At the same time, another message echoed in his ears.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Defeat the goblin king.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Time left: 9 min. 59 sec.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cGrrrrrrrrr\u2026 Is it Little Hobbit? Krrr\u2026 I\u2019m hungry\u2026 Stay still\u2026\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWait, it could talk.\u201d Nox surprisingly inquired. It was only natural since this was the native language of the monster family. Although Nox couldn't understand the language, he was shocked that a monster could speak.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Even though his fragile mind hadn't gotten over the past F-rank Dungeon, Every thought about it seemed to be displaced as soon as he confronted the shout of the impending Goblin King.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201c... Fuck!\u201d He was unable to fake ignorance, even if he tried.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Taking out his longsword from his inventory and getting himself ready to fight, he had to put good use to all his training for the past twelve hours.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cKRAAAAA\u2026 HOBBIT\u2026 STAY STILL!\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The grey lad approached Nox, threatening him with his overwhelming size and giant axe.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Compared to the monsters he faced in the tutorial and F-rank dungeon, this intimidation engulfed the depths of his heart. Every hair all over his body was aroused, and he stood on end as its shriek shuddered through his body.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nox wanted to run, flee from this impending danger, and sprint far away into the dark and soundless passageway, but if he did, that would expand the possibility of him dying the most pitiful death.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nox gnashed his teeth and resisted the overwhelming pressure. He did everything in his power to straighten out the fighting spirit he previously used during these few months, which was about to be broken.</span></p>\n<p>It was as if a huge gravitational pull were trying to suck him into itself, akin to a black hole.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Everything was holding him captive. Meanwhile, the loud thudding sound was approaching faster than his attempt to move his legs. Of course, this was the first time in a while that he had faced an overwhelming monster; he couldn't move an inch. What should he do now? All his legs could do was tremble in fear.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fight or run? Wait or die? Many introspection raced in and out of his mind as he analyzed every outcome of every action derived from those questions. Regardless of his thinking, his only hope was the time limit that rang each time a minute passed and the lengthy passageway from which the goblin was approaching.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Time left: 7 min, 15 sec.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He was thinking for two minutes and 45 seconds as the thudding sound of the Goblin King got clearer and more detailed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What if he kept thinking without taking any action for an extra 7 minutes out of fear? Will he just wait in front of a powerful enemy and die just because it is stronger than the last? No way. Nox chooses to accept the invitation because he wants to become stronger than anyone; he would rather not be a helpless blind man.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Therefore, that responds to the query.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He decided, his hands tightly clenching the hilt of the longsword in his hand as his dilated golden eyes narrowed underneath his blindfold. He'd rather fight to get stronger than lie helplessly to any of his enemies, now or later.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Soon, he focuses his [Sixth Sense] upfront, trying to auscultate the mana surging from the Goblin King. As if, the grey lad employed the darkest haze to conceal his mana, which disrupted his visual and lapped frequencies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As the thudding sound squirted throughout the passageway, Nox nervously spun around. A disruption\u2026? How is he supposed to sense its approach? Which direction would it spawn from?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Yet, he didn't have another choice but to find that point. Moreover, there's no way this sword would do anything to the goblin king. After all, he only made a few fortress points in the F-rank Dungeon and couldn't get himself a better weapon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Regardless, he has to fight, even if it costs his life. It was then, dissolving the pitch-black haze, that the grey lad zoomed out and slivered his axe through the air at Nox.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dazed at the impending metal crushing through the air, Nox couldn't help but pause his initial thinking as his [Sixth Senses] and his ears\u2014[Sound Reading]\u2014caught a glimpse of the energy signature.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the end, he coerced his body to move at the last minute to evade the axe, which crunched the ground with great impact.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It was then that Nox figured he could sense the lad if it got out of the haze.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Shortly after the counter at the left wing failed, the pitch-darkest haze enveloped the Goblin king, and he disappeared again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As Nox reluctantly curled his tongue, a red line drew itself across his cheek as blood seeped from within.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He dodged it too late. Though instead of panicking at this realization, he could have been dead if he was a tiny bit late. Nox kept cool-headed, realizing there was no use for that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">After all, that would only cause irrational decisions and an inability to think things through. One of the things Nox learned from listening to Hunter news, outbreaks, and successful raid articles from the most experienced hunters was that Monsters had magic cores.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And low-tier boss monsters akin to the Goblin King couldn't completely hide within their bodies due to their passive magic-gathering skill.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In that case, a sneer spread across Nox's lips as his eyes grew cold. Presumably, he was now well aware of its weakness.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Decided, he took a deep breath to relax the tension and nervousness within him, trying to grasp the tiniest visual and sound of the grey lad.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">8 seconds\u2026 7 seconds\u2026 6 seconds\u2026 5 seconds\u2026 4 seconds\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Found it. A glimpse of light shone forth through the rear as the surge wave bounced back after sticking to the core bulging from its body.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One. At that moment, Nox threw himself up, backflipping precisely and stylishly, evading the impending axe.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He could sense it now. Its stir, its magical signature, its frequencies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With its axe stuck on the wall, the Goblin King thrust in quick succession an unexpectedly hefty punch from the darkness in front of him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Of course, it was discernible since [Sixth Sense] had no weak spot, but Nox's reaction speed was on the slow side.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"Ugh!\" So he was sent flying into the darkness as the throbbing from the impact caused his body to go impassive as blood seeped from his mouth. Of course, if he didn't twist his body at the last second, he would die.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Despite the throbbing pain, Nox was filled with diverse thoughts. He's not that certain to get close to it. Even if he were able to get close by chance, how would he damage the core with his sword?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And what strength will he apply to the sword to deal that damage?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Of course, since his strength has risen past a normal human's physical strength, that strength can't be applied here.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Hell, those thoughts are palpable, as there's a possibility this sword wouldn't be able to leave a crack on it. Nox mused hard as many ideas rushed in and out of his mind, akin to a roll of film steering through a recorder. While he glances around, at which point the grey lad would appear again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If that's the case, he needs to at least attempt the only possibility he deems sufficient. He needs to react faster since this monster is smarter at utilizing its surroundings to its advantage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">His heterochromatic vision darted in every direction amid the swarming darkness. Would he be able to react that quickly to dodge its attacks? Who knows how many attacks it would attempt this time?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Of course, Nox shouldn't ponder like that, but his trembling arms and lack of air are making it more difficult to fight. Still, even after much contemplation, he couldn't find a way out of this situation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Above. Upon the detection of the Goblin King above, he felt a faint refractometric contour of the Grey Lad, as if a drop of water fell in a clear pond of water. His heart shrank; he felt like spewing out, yet his determination to get stronger jolted his heart awake, and thus he dodged the magical swinging blade.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The dodged attack shuddered and created a distorted, disfigured crater on the ground, and at the same time, as if the latter deemed Nox had lowered his guard, he threw a surprise attack.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It appeared at the rear, about to slice down his foe, but neither did it know; it was just playing in the palm of its foe's hand, luring him out of the shadow.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The sightless man twisted his body and bent to avoid the next magical sharp swing, then leaped his feet off the cozy ground toward the monster's base.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nonetheless, the bumpy, hefty hand of the Goblin King, steaming cold air from his mouth and nose, swiped down the magical, sharp axe, yanking it through the air and accelerating above him. Presently, the mana coating was a lot denser, transforming into an attack strong enough to immediately rip him to shreds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It seems the Goblin King is getting serious as well. Precisely, the deadly axe approached close to his hair. A feeling of warm and cold air lingering at the top of his hair; any further, it would all be over.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Regardless, it was a high-stakes, high-gain endeavor. Life without risk isn't a path to becoming stronger. Halted at the last minute, he lowered his body a bit, coating his feet with mana, an unexpected motion he had never done before. His feet were torn open, and blood gushed out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He accelerated past the axe's sharp blade, thus barely managing to avoid it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That attack splintered rocks, dirt, and dry moss everywhere as the thundering sound of the magic blade stuck to the ground. Those irritating frequencies burst out of Nox's eardrum as he groaned after screaming in pain.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Enduring it, he bit his lower lips and thrust his sword into both its feet in quick succession to unbalance its footing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cKIEEEEK!\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Goblin king loudly blurted out in pain, trying to stumble to recover his stance. The blind man nimbly loomed with both feet and kept striking it rapidly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cDon't be a coward and don't face me from high up; come down to my level of height, Jerk!\u201d Nox yelled as blood splashed as the blade of the sword pierced both feet at a fast pace, ignorantly letting his frustration out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Again. \u201cKIEEEKK!\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A sharp shriek whistled out from the Goblin King as it fell onto its back with a loud thud. Without hesitation, Nox jumped onto its grey, muscular chest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The core wouldn't break with such an impact; instead, a sharp sound echoed throughout the passageway while the blade sideways clashed with the sapphire-like core.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cUgh!\u201d Nox gnashed his teeth as blood burst out of his ears. Ignoring the pain, the flame of determination to triumph burned forth within his heart, and he continued to stab and slash with vigor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">After fifteen consecutive supernatural stabs. The core had had started to fracture.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cKRAAAAAA DIE\u2026 HOBBIT!\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As the Goblin King feared its impending death. Immediately, he threw a desperately magic-coated attack.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cShit, you're scared to die; we are both scared of dying!\u201d Nox shouted as his auditory and visual systems caught that; he threw him up without time to ponder and went with the flow.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cArgh!\u201d He barely missed his head, yet the aftereffect once again drove his body numb and shivering. Pure blind luck, There's nothing else that could describe that. Nox didn't stop, thrusting himself back down with full force and coating the tip of his sword with mana.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cGo to Hell.\" With great force, the sword tip struck the core and it's shattered.</span></p>\n<p><strong>The goblin king had been slain.</strong></p>\n            </div>",

        "chapter_content": "<div class=\"chapter-inner chapter-content\">\n                <p>Ethan powered on his laptop, a device he had modded for a singular purpose. As the screen flickered to life, the familiar boot sequence of Kali Linux materialized before his eyes, displaying a series of command-line messages. His fingers danced across the keyboard as he entered the password and username. With that done, he swiftly entered a command in the terminal.</p>\n<div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 98.7027%\"><span style=\"color: rgba(194, 225, 245, 1)\">msfconsole</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<p>He pressed enter, and the boot sequence continued in the bash terminal, initializing the familiar Metasploit framework\u2014his go-to tool. As the series of initializing messages appeared and the lines of code started reverberating on his screen with the constant flicker, a wave of memories rushed over him. He remembered, as a ten-year-old, returning home from the fourth grade, brimming with excitement to show his mother the medal he had won for the first prize he secured.</p>\n<p>Ethan swung open the door, proudly displaying the first prize medal he had earned in his class. 'Mom, look! I won first prize,' he exclaimed. However, instead of a joyful response, his ears were met with a tirade of unhinged words and anger.</p>\n<p>'This is your fault!' The words rang out laced with bitterness. \"You conceived when I wasn't ready! You ruined my life!\" Each word felt like a lash.</p>\n<p>His mother stood there, a visible reflection of his father's behavior. Tears coursed down her cheeks, leaving glistening trails in their wake. Her eyes were puffy, a telltale sign of the distress she felt. She held her arms close to her chest as if trying to protect herself from the onslaught of words. Her gaze was fixed on the ground, unable to meet his father's furious stare. Her whole body trembled, quivering under the weight of his rage.</p>\n<p>In the midst of the verbal storm, he noticed his father's eyes locked on her, filled with a twisted mix of anger and frustration. The man's voice reverberated with the sheer force of his words, a cruel symphony of blame and cruelty.</p>\n<p>\"Che, this happened because you were born!\" His father's voice echoed as he noticed Ethan. His father's frustration and anger were palpable; the words were a bitter reminder of their strained relationship. Quickly, he hurled the sandal he was holding at Ethan's face before storming out, the door slamming shut behind him.</p>\n<p>\"Mom, Mom!\" Ethan hurried toward his mother, his face filled with concern. \"What happened to you?\" he asked, his worry evident in his voice. 'Why did he come today?' He was already shocked to the core to see his father, but at that moment, instead of finding solace, his mother started beating him in frustration and shouted, \"This all happened because of you!\" The blows continued as she vented her anger and frustration on Ethan.</p>\n<p>The day Ethan came into this world should have been a celebration, but instead, it set in motion a chain of events that would forever shape his existence. The room that was meant to be filled with coos of joy was instead overshadowed by his mother's exhausted sighs and his father's silent desperation. From the moment his cries echoed through the hospital walls, a heavy cloud of uncertainty hung over his family. His father's eyes, once filled with hope, were now clouded by the weight of lost dreams and dashed expectations. With every medical bill that piled up and every creditor's call that went unanswered, the cracks in their marriage deepened, and Ethan became an unwitting symbol of their unraveling life.</p>\n<p>On that fateful day, when his father's carefully constructed financial stability crumbled under the weight of a fraudulent scheme, Ethan's world shifted on its axis. The very foundation of security that his family had known shattered, leaving them in the debris of broken promises and dashed hopes. Their once-comfortable home was replaced by the harsh reality of financial ruin, and the warm embrace of love was exchanged for the cold, unforgiving streets. As his father's shoulders slumped under the burden of his own failures, he turned his gaze towards the innocent bundle in his wife's arms, a bundle that now represented everything he had lost.</p>\n<p>Abandonment wasn't just an act; it was the manifestation of a father's inability to bear the weight of his own inadequacies. The bitter taste of resentment tainted every tear-stained memory, as his father chose to lay blame on an innocent infant rather than confront his own shortcomings. The curse of bad luck wasn't a label Ethan chose, but it became a heavy cloak he wore as he navigated a world marked by scarcity and strife.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>After that day, his mother's laughter became scarce, and her attention to Ethan grew distant. His father's presence was marked by a cloud of alcohol, and their interactions were strained and brief. Ethan often found solace in solitude, longing for the warmth of his mother's affection, which he rarely received. The strained dynamics in their household left him grappling with emotions that were difficult to express.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Apart from providing him with necessities and sending him to school, his mother hardly interacted with Ethan, leaving him with a lonely and distant childhood memory. Then, one day, his mother passed away, her tear-dried eyes etched in his memory. Despite her shortcomings, He cherished her as everything he ever had, as he had never experienced genuine family love.</p>\n<p>As the memories faded away, a single speck of tear rolled down Ethan's cheek as he returned to reality. With a heavy sigh, he muttered, \"Why did I think of this all of a sudden?\" He looked at the screen; the initializing of his command line on screen had ended, and now he was faced with the most challenging task of his life.</p>\n<p>Ethan, now at the age of twenty-one, bore dark circles from countless sleepless nights. His unkempt hair cascaded down to his neck; and despite being in his twenties, not a single hair of beard adorned his jawline. Dressed in regular black jeans and a white t-shirt that reeked of sweat and bore yellow stains, it was evident that he rarely bothered to wash his clothes.</p>\n<p>His nimble fingers flew across the keyboard as he sat on a broken wooden chair and a makeshift table that he had assembled using materials he had collected from the abandoned building where he currently resided. The building, once intended to be a residential area, was never completed due to illegal land scams orchestrated by the company, and currently, it was going through a legal battle.</p>\n<p>So it was the perfect place he had found to start his hacking endeavors; the whole building was surrounded by weeds and plants, and Ethan had carved out a route through the bushes that led him to his apartment, where he was the only one who knew this secret way to enter the building, or, you could say, no one bothered to enter the building premises.</p>\n<p>He accessed wireless internet through his dongle, and to shield his identity from the ISP, he built his own VPN backdoor. Despite VPNs provided by companies and their claims regarding data security, they track all the records, and for tasks like this, Ethan couldn't trust any VPN providers. So, after countless sleepless nights of research, he hacked a popular VPN client protocol to create an untraceable connection, and although it was illegal, for him, its functionality was what mattered most.</p>\n<p>If you were to ask him whether creating his own VPN was a difficult task, he would have laughed and replied, \"Well, it's way simpler than talking or approaching a girl.\"</p>\n<p>Ethan, now with all the security measures in check and the masking of his laptop's MAC address, felt fully prepared as he began writing the commands to initialize the hacking process. While he had only dabbled in minor hacks in the past, like obtaining free items online or exploiting illegal gambling websites, the task he was about to perform was on a whole different level.</p>\n<p>His target for the day was none other than OmniTech Industries, a multi-billion-dollar company with fields in construction and various manufacturing units. You might wonder why Ethan chose this particular company. Well, it was because of the illegal foundation upon which OmniTech Industries had been built. You see, in today's world, it's not uncommon for companies to have a questionable past, with even large Fortune 500 companies involved in unethical practices, especially in certain regions like Africa. However, there was something particularly sinister about OmniTech Industries that caught his attention.</p>\n<p>Before the company reached its current size and became renowned, its founder, Richard Emer, was involved in illegal land sales and various other chain marketing scams, victimizing his father in the process. Due to this despicable man, his life turned into a living hell. After meticulously tracing past routes and investigating the person behind his father's culprit, He discovered that OmniTech Industries was a result of Emer's misdeeds.</p>\n<p>Ever since he learned the truth about the mastermind behind the miseries, he kept a keen eye on his target, Richard Emer. He spent countless hours conducting reconnaissance and foot-printing of the company, gathering extensive server details, all in preparation for this crucial moment.</p>\n<p>His fingers danced across the keyboard as he entered the command in the terminal to conduct a preliminary scan of servers and their networks.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 99.0888%\"><span style=\"color: rgba(194, 225, 245, 1)\">nmap -sS -T4 192.168.1.100</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>After the scan, Ethan reviewed the results, analyzing the open ports and services on the target server. His goal was clear: he needed to find an entry point that would allow him to bypass the company's formidable firewall. With the details from the scan gathered, he jumped into a relentless search for specific exploits that he could take advantage of in the services and software running on the target server. To achieve this, he used the formidable power of the Metasploit framework.</p>\n<p>As Ethan continued to decrypt the discovered vulnerabilities, he set his sights on using the malware he had created to infiltrate the company's robust firewall. The firewall was like an impenetrable fortress, an Everest standing tall before him, yet he remained undeterred, fully focused on decrypting the firewall with his malware.</p>\n<p>\"Come on, come on, I can do this,\" he whispered to himself as his fingers danced on the keyboard.</p>\n<p>After several nerve-wracking attempts, an alert message flashed on the screen, and seeing the alert, his heart sank. The firewall was resilient, and he was one step away from being discovered.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, a breach failed with the message \"Firewall breach attempt detected. Security alert raised.\"</p>\n<p>Ethan, now completely frustrated, shouted, \"No, not now!\"</p>\n<p>But even though his digital footprint was detected and an alert was raised, Ethan at this moment did not care; even if he had to go to jail today, he was ready for it. He had only one goal in mind: to bring the founder, Richard Emer, on the road. Since the malware attempt failed to completely crack the firewall without raising a breach alert, he decided to attempt a brute-force attack, even if it meant getting caught.</p>\n<p>Hoping to directly force entry into the server, his fingers danced across the keyboard as he typed.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 99.0888%\"><span style=\"color: rgba(194, 225, 245, 1)\">Hydra -l usernames.txt -P passwords.txt 192.168.0.100 ftp</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Back at OmniTech Industries headquarters, a Security Analyst shouted, \"We've got an unauthorized intruder! Tracing the source now!\"</p>\n<p>The company's security team had already detected the unauthorized attempt from an unknown origin and activated their countermeasures. The security analyst team was determined to trace the source of the intrusion back to its origin. Amidst all of this, he continued to use his malware in an attempt to gain access.</p>\n<p>As Ethan was using his VPN to maintain his anonymity, the security team deployed sophisticated tracking techniques, and their virtual breadcrumbs led them closer and closer to his location. The team leader shouted to his team and spoke loudly, \"We're getting closer; the source is coming from an abandoned building on the outskirts of Rushville.\"</p>\n<p>As the security team desperately tried to contain the breach, Ethan's adrenaline surged as he knew he had to act quickly to complete his mission. He had to transfer the funds and expose the scams to the world before the servers were shut down. He remained focused and determined to see it through until the end, even though the security team had already raised the alarms.</p>\n<p>The security analyst spoke urgently, \"I am shutting down the servers now! But the hacker is still inside!\"</p>\n<p>Another Security Analyst chimed in, \"He must have found a way to bypass our firewall; I am trying to cut off his access.\"</p>\n<p>The Security Team Leader responded, \"This is an unprecedented breach. Keep trying to track him down, and make sure the FBI is on their way.\"</p>\n<p>Ethan had anticipated the response he would get and was prepared for this moment. As the servers started to shut down, he executed malware that would keep the fund transfer process ongoing while simultaneously publishing the scams and their victims on the web, even during the server closures.</p>\n<p>Amid chaos at the company's headquarters, Ethan watched as the funds started to flow to the victims. The transfer process was now automated, ensuring that the money would reach those who had suffered at the hands of scammer Richard Emer as the company went to ruins. His face reflected a mix of relief and anxiety. He had achieved his goal, but now the stakes were higher than ever. His identity was no longer that of just a skilled hacker; he had become a digital vigilante, and the FBI was on the hunt.</p>\n<p>Ethan sighed to himself in contempt: \"It's done. The victims will finally get what they deserve.\"</p>\n<p>Then he got up from the broken wooden chair. He could hear the wailing sirens and the approaching helicopter from a distance. His heart started racing as he saw that his task was 100 percent complete. He took out the wallet from his pocket and retrieved the photo. Then he threw the wallet on the terrace floor, followed by his bag, laptop, dongle, chargers, wooden table, and chair, making a pile. Once done, he set everything on fire, leaving no trace behind.</p>\n<p>As he prepared himself for the impending consequences and was about to flee from sight, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. The hairs on the back of his neck stood on end, and his instincts screamed at him to be on high alert.</p>\n<p>But as he was about to leave the site, a red sniper light fell on Ethan, and he heard the FBI shouting for him to put his hands up. \"FBI! Put your hands up!\" Ethan, now surrounded, held his hands up high, but he remained unfazed by the impending consequences. In a mutter, he spoke, \"I hope this will finally put an end to my father's constant blame.\"</p>\n<p>As the FBI surrounded him, his hands held high, clutching a nearly faded photo he had just taken out of the wallet, a fire was burning down the possessions that he had ignited. Suddenly, as the FBI closed in and the helicopter's strong wind roared, the photo slipped from Ethan's clutch and fell into the pit of fire, starting to burn its edges.</p>\n<p>\"No, no,\" Ethan panicked as he quickly crouched down to grab the photo. The FBI shouted again, \"Don't move!\", But it was too late. Ethan promptly went towards the fire to retrieve the photo, but this sudden haste from him resulted in his life as a bullet went past through his chest, piercing his organs.</p>\n<p>\"Aaaaaahhhhhh,\" Ethan cried in pain.</p>\n<p>A fountain of blood spurted out from his chest, and Ethan cried loudly in pain and anguish as he fell on the terrace floor with a loud thud, his hand holding the photo that had almost caught fire at the edges; the ashes covered the face, but he could still make out from whatever it had left that it was a photo of a female whom he clutched in his hands.</p>\n<p>Ethan let out a huge sigh as he looked at the photo with tears rolling down his cheeks, knowing that this was his final moment as he lay on the ground covered with his blood, wounded and surrounded by the approaching FBI team. With his last strength, he stammered a few words, his emotions overwhelming him.</p>\n<p>\"I hope you are in a good place, Mom,\" he whispered, his voice choked with sadness and regret. \"Only if the situation was different, would you have still loved me?\" Tears started rolling down the ground as he continued whispering, \"I wish I could meet you again soon.\"</p>\n<p>As the sirens continued ringing, Ethan clutched the photo tightly as if he were trying to hold onto the fleeting memories of a love he had always yearned for. With a final deep breath, he closed his eyes, finding solace in his last moments. At least in his final act, he had achieved a form of redemption for himself from his father's constant blame.</p>\n<p>Ironically, in his final moments, Ethan found himself within the very building owned by Richard Emer, the owner of OmniTech Industries\u2014the very place he had chosen to carry out his hacking endeavors and take his revenge against the man who caused so much misery in his life. As he lay on the floor, bleeding and surrounded by the approaching FBI team, Ethan couldn't help but chuckle bitterly at the irony of the situation.</p>\n<p>With his last ounce of strength, Ethan whispered, 'I love you, Mom,' and then embraced the darkness.</p>\n            </div>",

Later we\u2019d see the video feeds. Lawyers summoned to fight orcs. Politicians torn apart by hordes of undead. The president, eaten by a dragon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The words chimed into everyone\u2019s head, but most people ignored them. They hadn\u2019t yet learned to tell a System message from a stray thought.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">Please enjoy the tutorial.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">Make peace with your gods and loved ones.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">It will be the easiest the game ever gets.</span></p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Logan was out in the cold, sweeping a flashlight across the storage facility where he worked as a night guard. The snow crunched under his boots. The night was barely worth calling night at all, with the lights of the city so densely clustered that they made the air more of a darkish haze than a proper starry black.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And then those lights went out. One by one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The city seemed to washaway in a tide of total void. The world narrowed to the small window of snow and scrubby weeds Logan could see in the flashlight\u2019s beam.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He looked up and thought, </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Blackout?</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But already he knew that wasn\u2019t true. Blackouts didn\u2019t turn the stars in the sky off.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">His flashlight abruptly sputtered. Flickered. Went out.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">Your rank has been assessed.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">\u2013 Slave \u2013</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When the lights came on Logan was in an elevator. A shiny chrome one, his reflection staring back at him from the polished walls. There was still snow in the collar of his jacket and the flashlight in his hand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWhat the fuck\u2013\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The doors slid open. Beyond them was a massive hotel dining room. White-sheeted tables stood ready with food. Food like Logan had only seen in movies. Whole roasted boars, massive cakes dripping with perfect frosting and dots of jelly, glasses of bubbling champagne.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">All around the edges of the room, countless elevator doors were opening. Every one had a single person inside.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There was a scream from somewhere in the room. Instantly, a dozen nervous gazes shifted over to the man in a cheap suit having a hysterical fit, sinking down and clutching his head. Logan could faintly hear </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">oh god oh god oh god</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> repeating under the sound of sobbing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A second later he snapped over to an entirely different kind of scream\u2013 a shout of delight. A filthy man in rags, clearly homeless and clearly hungry, had seen the feast. And now he was launching himself at the nearest table to shovel food onto a plate, stabbing away a chicken thigh and spooning up heaping helpfuls of mashed potatoes, gravy, and green beans.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Everyone watched as he settled himself down in a chair and began to eat. He looked up, saw the gazes fixed on him, and said\u2013</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWell? Y\u2019all better learn to eat when there\u2019s food on the table.\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Logan chuckled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Yeah, this felt like he was probably flat fucked. The strange phrase that had chimed in his mind stuck out to him. The last word especially: \u2018Slave\u2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As he looked around the room, what he saw were college students, teachers, the elderly, and a great deal of people who just looked normal. Not normal like you\u2019d see in a movie, normal like you\u2019d see in a parking lot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The sound of the beggar eating was the only sound for a second. Then someone asked, \u201cDid all of you hear that? \u2018Your rank has been assessed\u2019?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cYeah! Do you know what the fuck\u2019s happening?\u201d Someone else called. \u201cI was with my wife a second ago!\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Logan stepped out of the elevator. As the doors slid shut behind him, there was a kind of funny electric feeling to the air. When he turned back the doors were gone. Only unbroken wall covered in red and gold wallpaper remained.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Yep. We\u2019re all here to die.</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Logan gave the food a wary glance. Several people were already helping themselves, clearly not having seen a meal like this in a long, long time. Others were refusing to leave the elevators.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The most interesting people had left the elevators, but weren\u2019t eating. They were clustered together in groups, talking, exchanging information. They were the ones trying to figure out what was happening. As Logan stepped forward into the room, a bright-eyed woman with blonde hair stepped up to him. He read ex-military in her shoulders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cYou got the message too, right? Being assessed as a slave?\u201d She asked.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Logan nodded. \u201cYeah, I think I heard something before that too. Something about tutorials. It sounded like a threat.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cMhm.\u201d She grimaced. \u201cYou\u2019re a security guard, right?\u201d She pointed at the Securistar Services emblem pinned to his coat. \u201cDo you have a gun?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cNo.\u201d He lied on instinct. \u201cCompany doesn\u2019t let me have one. Might get sued if I go off half-cocked.\u201d Which was true. He just carried one anyway.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cDamn. Nobody has any weapons\u2013 some of us were carrying when we got\u2026\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cPulled in?\u201d Logan suggested.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cPulled in. When the lights went out.\" She agreed. \u201cWhatever brought us here made our guns vanish. Our phones too. Right now the best weapons we\u2019ve got are some pocket knives and your flashlight.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2018We\u2019 nothing.</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I don\u2019t trust any of you.</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The thought flashed through Logan\u2019s head. He was just waiting for her to turn around so he could check if his pistol was really gone. He didn\u2019t doubt it. There was an odd lack of weight in the underarm holster. This was an unknown situation. So the first rule was to keep track of what you knew, what you thought you knew, and what you definitely didn\u2019t know. If you let the lines cross\u2026 If you started accepting things as fact, like that everyone here got here the same way\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You ended up a sucker.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWe\u2019re trying to put together\u2026\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cA resistance?\u201d He raised an eyebrow. \u201cI get it. But I\u2019m pretty sure I just got here by magic or sufficiently advanced technology. Either way\u2026\u201d A shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know enough to toss my way in one way or the other.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Disappointment on her face, and her eyes glanced towards the flashlight, but then she shrugged back. \u201cYour call. Good luck.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As he stepped away, someone shouted\u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t step out! The elevators are disappearing! Stay inside, they won\u2019t vanish with you in them!\u201d</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Or they will.</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Logan thought. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And someone will die on your advice.</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">They had been designated as slaves, taken to a strange location, and given food. Nobody had presented themselves to explain what was going on, yet. If he had to guess they were waiting for any rebellious minds in the crowd to reveal themselves\u2026</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And if you want to lead animals by the nose, you always put a traitor in the mix. </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Back on the farm where he was raised there was something called the Judas Goat. One goat that always survived the slaughter, because it was on the butcher\u2019s side. It would go at the head of the line walking towards the slaughtering pens and every other goat would follow calmly, thinking there was nothing to fear. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Logan ripped the security company emblem off his jacket, not wanting to be identified again. When he tucked a hand in to check, the gun was gone from his holster, but there was something else there in its place\u2026 </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">His hand met crisp, reinforced paper, and he pulled out a playing card.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Huh.</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It was beautifully made. A frame of white thorns surrounded hand drawn art of a deathly hand holding a pale candle. The moment he looked at it a voice spoke into his head, and Logan had to restrain the urge to spin around as if there was someone behind him.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">Evocation</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">????</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">????</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br></span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Well that\u2019s useful. And how do you </span></em><strong><em>say</em></strong><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> a question mark?</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He opened his wallet to stow the card away, but there was another discovery waiting for him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">His money was gone too. In its place was a second card, depicting a row of faceless men shackled together at the neck.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">The Fetters</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">????</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">????</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If this is some kind of test, maybe these are game pieces, </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">was his first thought.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Moving past one of the tables, he picked up a plate and forked up some bits of rare, pepper-crusted meat from a floating dish full of pinkish-red sauce. It wasn\u2019t actually beef, he noted. There were scales on the outer edges, crisped to brown. Like some cross between fish and cattle.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Like hell I\u2019m actually eating this. But\u2026 I want to look like I\u2019m docile\u2026</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The elevators were largely gone now. The sobbing man had been helped to a chair and was chugging glasses of champagne. People had begun to sit down and help themselves, nervously.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It made no sense to be eating right now\u2013 but if you put people in a dining hall and confused them bad enough, they\u2019d eat on instinct.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There was a slight chime. Logan\u2019s gaze went up, and he spotted old fashioned box speakers set into the ceiling. He was sure they\u2019d just now appeared out of nowhere.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cAhem.\u201d</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cSome of you are wondering\u2013 and some of you are already figuring out\u2013 what is happening here\u2026\u201d</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI\u2019m going to say first and foremost you are safe.\u201d</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cAs the lowest class among your world\u2019s people, you will not be required to fight for your survival. Only the ruling classes are forced to take the tutorial.\u201d</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cSurvival of the fittest has come to your world. No longer will anyone be coddled or given any excuses. Pure merit is the only way to survive. Some of you will no doubt show some strength of character and rise to the top. And for some of you, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s bad news\u2026\u201d</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cBut for now, you are safe.\u201d</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cYour world is being conquered, but you peons have no doubt long ago become accustomed to the state of servitude. You will enjoy generous benefits in your new positions.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Well that\u2019s honest. Honest enough to tell me this person doesn\u2019t give a fuck what we think or do.</span></em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cIf you remain in this hotel, the ones outside taking the tutorial will be able to recruit from your numbers. You will enter the game as pawns protected by a ruler, and serving a side.\u201d</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cIf you wish to play this game yourself\u2026\u201d</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThe door will open in ten minutes. Those who wish to compete can step through one at a time. They will face an appropriate challenge, determining life or death. Such is the penalty for freedom in this world.\u201d</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cFurther explanations will be given after you\u2019ve made your choice. In the meantime\u2026 Enjoy the food!\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The speakers shut off with a crackle of static.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">From all around the room, screaming started. Logan didn't hesitate. He kicked a table over, food spilling to the floor, and ducked behind it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">No attack came.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The screaming was coming from the elevators. The doors were closing, with people still inside. Some of them ran out immediately. Others were actually trying to shove their way back in. One woman had pressed herself to the far wall as a man, presumably her husband, begged her to come out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">She just kept shaking her head, face as white as a ghost. The doors slid shut. There was a ripple in the air like reality blinking and--</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">They were gone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Logan rose from behind the table, grabbing a chair and sitting down. He'd reacted too quickly and without reading the situation properly. Despite everything his nerves were getting to him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Checking his pockets he found a battered pack of cigarettes, half empty. And in case it mattered, a candy bar, a swiss army knife, and a lighter.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Might be the last cigarettes I ever see... Might be the last candybar.</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He lit up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">By the time the cigarette had burned down to ash something else about the room had changed. Hanging from the ceiling were crystal chandeliers, exactly like a fancy hotel would have. But now the lights within were moving. They drifted out of the glass and began to swim around the ceiling, pouring into streams and lakes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Wherever the light gathered into a large pool, half-translucent images began to appear inside.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A man desperately running through a desert pursued by an enormous, twin-tailed scorpion. The scorpion's body was made of rusting black iron and its barbed tails glowed like heated metal, dripping ash and cinders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another image showed a woman in a camo military jacket crouched behind a tree. Arrows were whipping through the air but there was no sight of the attackers. The woman was praying, head down, arms curled around an assault rifle.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lucky</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Logan thought. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">They've got a gun and a chance.</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The images flickered out as the combatants died-- or won their trial.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It wasn't many of them but...</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Logan watched a young man beat an ugly green-skinned toad creature to death, smashing its skull against the stony walls of the cave where they fought...</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A man in a mechanic's shop splashed oil over a massive blob of stringy, snot-yellow slime and burned it to death...</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A fight in a convenience store between an older Mexican fellow and a hulking lizardman ended very quickly when the gentleman dove behind the counter and found a shotgun...</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Everyone was so busy watching the fights play out...</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Logan was the first to notice the door had opened. It was hidden in a corner of the room with no tables and no lights. Just a simple fire door, with a dim neon sign that said EXIT above it.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Do I go?</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The people on the 'TV' got a fighting chance, but... Maybe slaves are stuck. Maybe the images are fake. Maybe this is a test...</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Then again maybe it's hell.</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He stood up quietly, putting another cigarette in his mouth and lighting up as he slouched towards the exit, flashlight tucked beneath his arm. As he passed the last table he grabbed a steak knife and tucked it down into his belt.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Doubt keeps you sharp but there can be too much of a good thing.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If they really intend to kill me for walking through this door...</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Then I'd rather fight now, rather then after weeks of starvation and abuse have worn me down.</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That was the classic mistake that made people so controllable. They would wait for a perfect chance to escape, never realizing that the time they spent waiting was robbing them of the strength to fight back.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Logan stepped through the door.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It swung shut behind him with a deafening ring.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He was inside an industrial kitchen. Every surface was covered in rust, mold, or grime. Flecks of something like ash were falling from the ceiling, dissolving without cold or heat as they touched his skin. The air itself was deathly cold like the inside of a meat freezer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The lights were all off except for one. Lit up at the end of the room was a single fridge colored red, the door hanging open.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">Within the fridge you will find this trial's objective.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">Protect the contents.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Inside were human eyes, staring out from under a layer of plastic wrap that secured them to a styrofoam tray. Like cuts of meat at the supermarket. Behind them was a human brain, the glossy transparent wrap sealed so vacuum tight that it sank into the wrinkles and folds of the fatty pink-gray meat.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Beneath were more organs. Lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, and balls.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">Anything missing from the fridge and not replaced before the end of the trial will be repaid from your body.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">Ten minutes remain.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">Begin.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">OH FUCK.</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A snorting, piggish sound erupted from the end of the room, and Logan\u2019s head swung in that direction, eyes trying to focus through the shadows. Too late. He barely caught sight of something rocketing towards him out of the dark.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the moment before collision he dropped his shoulder, turned with the impact, and did his best to roll with the strike. The attacker struck him dead in the shoulder and went ricocheting into the large steel table that filled the middle of the kitchen. Pots, pans, knives\u2013 everything went flying as the enemy\u2019s skull dented the steel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Logan hit the ground and tumbled across the moldy, frozen tiles. On a good day it might have been a roll. With all the wind knocked out of him, it was more of a slow groaning flop. He got onto his knees and grabbed a shelf to stand up but his shoulder was probably a lost cause. The burn of a bruise forming in real-time was biting deep into his muscle and he could feel that the bone below had popped free of the socket.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Small consolation\u2026.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">His enemy was doing worse. It was some kind of bipedal pigman: all fat and muscle, with skinny arms so small they reminded him of a tyrannosaurus counterbalanced by powerful, overbuilt legs that ended in hooves. Its belly was a sagging dome. It had the head of a feral pig crossed with a toad: wide mouth, tusks, eyes that bulged out of their sockets, rubbery drooling lips. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It was about four and a half feet tall\u2013 meaning it had hit the table headfirst. Those overlarge eyes were blinking dumbly, its mouth moving as it snorted and sniffled, but it seemed barely conscious. Its head was slumped down against the metal in a pool of blood. Probably concussed.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So this is gonna suck\u2026</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Logan grabbed his dislocated arm and tried to push it back into place. The pain was worse than he expected. It was so intense his vision burned white and the gristly pop of the joint re-socketing echoed in his head for a numb moment.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Oh that REALLY SUCKED.</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He swung his arm in a circle, forcing it to move before pain could lock the muscles tight. Lifting his flashlight he lunged at the creature.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Not the head. Skull\u2019s too thick. Focus on getting it down.</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He swiped the flashlight into its knee from the side, knocking the joint out of alignment. His elbow swung up into its soft throat, punching the wind out of its lungs. He followed through into a rising uppercut from the flashlight that chipped off one of the beast\u2019s tusks and sent it sprawling to the ground.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The problem was\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2018Down\u2019 didn\u2019t mean \u2018dead\u2019 and now things got nasty.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Drawing the steak knife from his belt, Logan dropped his knee onto the boarman\u2019s stomach and sank his weight down to pin it to the floor. Yellow blood squirted up and splattered across his sleeves as he drove the knife into its throat, ripped it out, and stabbed again. Over and over until the job was done.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He could hardly see straight through the particular mix of pain, exhaustion, and adrenaline flooding through his system.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So why am I smiling?</span></em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">Reinforcements arriving.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Two words chimed and Logan\u2019s good mood dissipated. He didn\u2019t bother looking this time as he heard that same snorting sound\u2013 remarkably close to a motorcycle revving up\u2013 from either side of the long kitchen hallway.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He just moved. Instinct told him where to go.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Grabbing the edge of the table, he kicked himself up and vaulted out of the way. The pigman ripped through where he\u2019d been instants before and crashed into a shelving unit, spilling down pots and pans.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Logan landed on the far side of the kitchen table. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">His head snapped around to the goalpost\u2013 the fridge. The second one was heading right towards it, diving for the meat on the shelves.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Shit.</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Vaulting back over, Logan tackled the pig instants before it reached the fridge. They spilled onto the floor, him cracking down with the flashlight, the creature screaming and screeching like an ape. He slammed the knife into its belly. One of its legs managed to get under him and kick up into his gut.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Winded, he was thrown back onto his ass.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A snort ripped through the air behind him. By now, Logan could feel the attack coming.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He just couldn\u2019t get out of the way in time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Logan barely managed to throw himself out of the way of a full killing blow. The pig slammed into him from behind and its tusk tore across his shoulders, opening a deep gash. He was tossed to the ground, and for a long moment there was no fuel left in his tank to stand back up with. Darkness grew at the edges of his vision.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Get up come on get up come on don\u2019t die here don\u2019t just lie here and fucking die\u2026</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Somewhere in that darkness he heard piggish grunting and the sound of chewing. Flesh being squished and crushed between teeth. Styrofoam squeaking.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A burst of sheer rage got him back onto his feet. The pigs were shoving their faces into the fridge, chewing and squealing with stupid delight.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He grabbed one of them by the leg and dragged it back out. The pig thrashed, trying to fight its way back to the meal, but Logan wrapped his arms around its thick neck and pulled the flashlight across its throat, gripping each end to use it as an iron bar. With a single hard pull he lifted the beast off its feet, suspending the beast in the air as its legs kicked and struggled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He stepped back. The second pig had just now, reluctantly, lifted its nose out of the freezer. Its bugged-out eyes focused on him. Its hairy nostrils snorted.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cC\u2019mon.\u201d Logan spat out. \u201cDo it.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He had the first one as a living shield\u2013 but the pig didn\u2019t care. It was a lean mean charging machine, and its brain had two directions: \u2018eat\u2019 and \u2018forward\u2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It chose </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">forward</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Its hooves cracked the tile underfoot as it rocketed forward, accelerating faster than should have been possible within the laws of physics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Blood and gore sloshed Logan\u2019s legs as he was thrown back. Something\u2013 a red wood box\u2013 dropped alongside the pots and pans that fell as he hit the shelves, agony stabbing through his injured back. He staggered, barely managing to keep to his feet this time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The pig in his arms was deader than dead. Its entire belly had been torn open by its brother\u2019s tusk, letting its inside spill out. He tossed the body aside, and grabbed for a knife from the kitchen table. It was a nice big cleaver and the weight felt right in his palm.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As the surviving pig stumbled about, drunk on concussions, Logan tackled it to the ground and swung the cleaver into its thigh. Three hard hacks separated bone and flesh. </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Can\u2019t kill it. Killing the first one brought reinforcements\u2013 more might show up after this one.</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> He thought.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Grabbing the squealing and whimpering creature by the arm he dragged it towards the walk-in freezer at the edge of the kitchen, pulling it open and kicking the crippled pig inside. As he slammed the metal door shut\u2013</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There was silence in the kitchen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Logan slumped across the table, gasping and panting, blood soaking through his clothes. He no longer knew what was his and what was from the pigs.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Head up buddy. C\u2019mon. </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He gritted his teeth.</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> One last shitty job\u2026</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The pigs had eaten the brains, balls, and one of the eyes. They had to be replaced, or they were coming out of Logan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The voice had said ten minutes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Logan didn\u2019t know how much time had passed while he was on the ground, but it couldn\u2019t be more than a minute or two could it?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As he walked towards the body of the dead pigs he grabbed the butcher\u2019s knife from the floor. Looking around, he found a big meat tenderizer mallet, something that could hopefully crack that idiot skull open.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Oh yeah. This is gonna get</span></em><strong><em> bad.</em></strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2014 \u2014 -\u2013</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Logan dropped the squishy, horribly wet brain onto the wire rack inside the fridge, and slumped back. His sleeves were rolled up and his hands were completely soaked in dark dense blood.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He counted the breaths until the voice spoke again\u2013</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Wanting to know how long he\u2019d had, and how close he\u2019d come to losing his own head.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Two\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Three\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He had reached forty-two and his eyes were beginning to sink shut when it finally happened.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\"><strong>Trial Completed.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">You have earned your freedom, and proven your strength.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">System Initializing.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A shimmering wave of blue-green static ran across Logan\u2019s eyes. He blinked and\u2013</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It was like there was a new layer of colors to the air. The corpses of the pigs glowed with an eerie aura. It was at once very sickly and weak but also alarmingly bright\u2013 beyond that it was impossible to describe, the way you could really only say yellow was the color of yellow things.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As for the mold and grime covering the kitchen, it also had one of those new colors.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fuck this. Time to name \u2018em.</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Gnu. It was covered by a gnu-colored aura.

Three cards appeared floating in the air in front of Logan, and a ring formed on his finger. The card on the right was printed with the image of a skeletal body laid in a coffin, holding a silver sword across its chest. The relatively dull ink used for the bone made the reflective silver of the sword stand out.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\"><strong>The Inheritance</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">(1 of 1) Summon a weapon from your world\u2019s past.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">(Tier 0 \u2756 Weapon Anchor x3)</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The moment he looked at it more words chimed through his head. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">Throughout the world exist countless Fortune Cards.

Or three for a weapon?</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He looked at the bloodsoaked mallet and cleaver lying on the ground. He had weapons. Not particularly good ones, though. Nothing that gave him the security of a gun.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I only have two slots for Skills. If I fill those up with bad choices, I could be in trouble\u2026</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As he thought, he turned the ring over on his finger. It was a steel band with a single dark gem. Tapping one of the cards against it, Logan discovered they vanished the moment they touched the surface. Pressing down on the gem, he watched as a beam of light shot out and displayed an interface holographically - ten empty slots, with the cards he'd stored slotted into place.<br></span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Weapon. I need a weapon more. </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He finally decided.<br></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But something made him pause. There had been\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A box. It had fallen off the shelves when he crashed into them. And it had been almost exactly the size of a card. The voice had said cards could be found inside Trials\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Stomping over he picked up the box and snapped it open. Within was a single card.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\"><strong>The Candle</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">(1 of 1) Grants increased experience for 1 hour.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">( Tier 0 \u2756 Augment )</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He shuffled through the handful of cards, letting the voice read their effects to him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It seemed fairly obvious that Anchors were more valuable than Augments. So he probably wanted to save his Skill Anchor. And if he was saving the Evocation card, that left\u2026</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Inheritance. Fetters. Candle. Now how do I\u2026</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Wanting them to combine seemed to be enough. The cards lit up gold, shining so brightly the material underneath seemed to vanish and only the light remained. The golden outlines fused together, fusing into a hazy cloud of light. A dark shape appeared within.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Logan reached in and pulled his weapon out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It was an antique lantern hanging from a long chain. The glass was reinforced by metal bands that bristled with sharpened spikes. The chain was made of pencil-thick</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">bands of rusted iron, and long enough to wind around his arm several times. Logan tilted his head.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Not exactly what I was thinking. But\u2026</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He gave it a swing, sweeping the lantern through the air. It had a good weight and those spikes promised to make impact nasty. </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Basically a weird flail.</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At the end of the room, elevator doors had appeared. Apparently the last requirement to leave the trial was to use his cards. Tucking the Evocation, the Culling, and his stat card down into his card ring, he wound the chain around his forearm to tighten the flail\u2019s range and walked towards the exit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The doors slid open for him.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">Where do you wish to go?</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">As the first human of this tower to complete a Crucible, you have earned the right to be teleported anywhere you wish.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">You can return to your planet, or visit another world currently in the Tutorial.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">All zones beyond the Tutorial are presently locked.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He paused. This was the first time the \u2018System voice\u2019 had asked him something. Actually\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now that he focused, when the System spoke to him he could</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> taste</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> one of those new colors, somehow. Synesthesia. Useful if he ever needed to tell a real message from a fake.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWhere am I, right now?\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">You are in Tower #3,182.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">This tower is designated as a mixed type, Nightmare Hotel.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">It serves to contain enslaved citizens and auction them off to contenders within the System.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\">It is owned by the Iok\u2019Sha Medicinal Guild and ruled by their Fifth Prince, Craith Iok\u2019Sha.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The elevator would take him away.

The style was like an imperial palace. There were massive pillars of red enamel covered in golden statues of lizards, birds, and serpents. Green and blue upholstered chairs sat around pools of water. The floors were mosaic tiles. The walls were covered by unpainted, white marble statues.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A light was flickering from one of the doors leading out of the main rooms. There was a light splashing, and the sound of running water.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Holy fuck. He\u2019s taking a bath\u2026</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Barely able to believe his luck, Logan crept forward.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The bathroom was the size of a swimming pool. Fragrant oils poured out of golden taps to fill the bath with lathering suds. Idly leaned back against the edge of the pool, a mud mask on his face and cucumber slices over his eyes, was a blue-skinned creature with pointed ears and unnaturally sharp features.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Logan swept the chained lantern over his head, and the swooping rush of air made the creature turn and say, \u201cWha-\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The word was cut off as the lantern slammed into his face. He went down with a splash, dropping below the surface of the pool as blood and teeth billowed up in a cloud behind him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Logan didn\u2019t hesitate to dive in after. As the water erupted into foam he grabbed the man by the shoulder, hauled him up, and cracked his head into the edge of the pool. There was a satisfying crunch as the creature\u2019s nose broke, and Logan simply repeated the motion a few times, taking vicious joy in feeling the hollow thump of bone rebounding off the hard ceramic edge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cPlease\u2013 I have money\u2013\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cOh yeah? Well, I know where you got it.\u201d Logan replied, almost jovial. He made the idiot\u2019s head go </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">smack</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> again. \u201cHow much do you have? Make me an offer. I want to hear it\u2026\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And he did want to hear this fucker beg.<br></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He just knew there wasn\u2019t a number on Earth that would be enough.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cT-trillions\u2026\u201d The creature had to know that wasn\u2019t the right answer\u2013 but fear made you say stupid things. The alien was trying to reach for something at the edge of the pool, a long prism of black crystal. Logan yanked him back before his fingers could even brush it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWow. Congratulations. That\u2019s a lot of slaves.\u201d Logan wound the chain around his throat, dragging the heavy links into place. \u201cBut I only take credit card.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The man\u2019s hands grasped at the chains, desperately trying to get his fingernails underneath and pull them away. Logan yanked him back from the edge of the pool, dragging him deeper. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWelcome to Earth. We\u2019ve got a saying around here\u2026\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He ragged the chains so tight his bruised arms and blood-soaked fingers ached.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cYou can\u2019t take it with you.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He plunged the alien under the pool\u2019s surface and held him down. All four limbs kicked wildly\u2013 for a moment the alien man managed to reach up and claw his manicured fingernails down Logan\u2019s front, but it was hardly even a resistance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Logan had made a bet, coming here\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If the game was fair, then standing at the top would be a boss that would just tear him to shreds. One hit would have turned him to a meat paste\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But when had the game ever been fair?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He\u2019d heard the voice over the loudspeaker and knew exactly who it belonged to. It was the voice of a rich asshole living off daddy\u2019s money, and that was the same everywhere. Logan felt genuine rage surging through him. It was a white-hot, blinding rage, one that made it impossible for him to even breathe, as if he was the one being choked.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He didn\u2019t think of himself as violent or unreasonable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But what made him so goddamn angry was this\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The whole world seemed to have ended, and still nothing had changed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Standing at the top of every tower was a soft-skinned creep who whined they had to \u2018work\u2019 when they spent all day sitting at meetings, eating steak off the company card, and playing golf.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If the world won\u2019t change\u2013 I\u2019ll change.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If the world won\u2019t change\u2013 I\u2019ll make it.</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The thrashing within the binding chain had ceased. The creature\u2019s limbs floated softly in the pool, its face an ugly bruised purple.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\"><strong>\u2013 Achievement Unlocked \u2013</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\"><strong>Eat the Rich</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Kill another player with at least a million coin, while having less than a hundred coins to your name.</span></em></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\"><strong>\u2013 Achievement Unlocked \u2013</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\"><strong>Eat the Rich (II)</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Kill another player with at least a billion coins, while having less than a hundred coins to your name.</span></em></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\"><strong>\u2013 Achievement Unlocked \u2013</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\"><strong>Eat the Rich (III)</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Kill another player with at least a trillion coins, while having less than a hundred coins to your name.</span></em></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\"><strong>\u2013 Achievement Unlocked \u2013</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\"><strong>Liberator</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Free at least a hundred slaves.</span></em></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\"><strong>\u2013 Achievement Unlocked \u2013</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\"><strong>First Monarch</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"color: rgba(22, 145, 121, 1)\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Be the first Native to attain a Tower.</span></em></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Words buzzed through his skull but Logan was in no place to process them.

        "chapter_content": "<div class=\"chapter-inner chapter-content\">\n                <p>\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you, Seth, it\u2019s a spear not a sword. The riposte is different.\u201d</p>\n<p>Seth ducked another jab from his brother\u2019s spear, his human speed barely keeping up as Jonathan\u2019s words went in one ear and spilled out the other.</p>\n<p>Of course the riposte was different. Seth moved his spear to his side in defense and caught his brother\u2019s blow. His defense was acceptable but the force sent him staggering with so much vehemence it was a surprise he didn\u2019t fall.</p>\n<p>His arms throbbed as he caught himself. Luckily, he stopped himself from tripping over his own feet. With a frown, he repositioned himself and took his stance again. The tip of his spear was held forward and pointed down. Despite his stance, he was fatigued. The strain left him panting like a child who\u2019d run a marathon and not a thirteen-year-old boy who\u2019d just defended himself with the spear for the last three\u2026 maybe four minutes.</p>\n<p>He really hoped it was at least five minutes.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Derek smirked.</p>\n<p>Seth\u2019s scowl touched more than just his lips. It reached so far that he scowled with his entire face as he looked at his brother.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t goad him, Derek,\u201d Jonathan warned from where he stood watching from the sidelines. \u201cThat\u2019s not the lesson we\u2019re trying to teach him today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s the lesson I\u2019m supposed to be learning today?\u201d Seth snapped at his older brothers, \u201cHow to survive against a Silver mage? I\u2019m only human, for crying out loud.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA weak human at that,\u201d Derek laughed. \u201cWeak and faulty.\u201d</p>\n<p>Seth\u2019s scowl deepened until he could feel his facial muscles grow sore. It was becoming as sore as his entire body. As a child of House Darnesh, it was his duty to learn how to use a spear. It was the family\u2019s official weapon, and their use of it was meant to be unparalleled in the entire territory. This was a rule Seth had no grievance with. Sadly, he lacked any talent for the spear. However, as a third child, five years younger than Derek, he was sparring far above his weight class.</p>\n<p>Derek was already a soul mage. And at his level, he was gravely more than capable of killing Seth with a casual swipe of his hand. So training with him, regardless of how much he held back, was simply a punishment.</p>\n<p>Jonathan spared him a simple look.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou,\u201d he said in his smooth and regal baritone, \u201care supposed to learn how to stop swinging a spear like it\u2019s an overgrown bat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Under his oldest brother\u2019s gaze, Seth\u2019s frown withered.</p>\n<p>Derek was stronger than Seth, but Jonathan was more so. What Derek could do to Seth with a simple slap, Jonathan could do to Derek with a bit more seriousness in his slap. So Seth reminded himself that not all grievances were meant to be voiced.</p>\n<p>They were in the family training hall, in a basement built deep and wide under the family home. It was vast and the ground was covered in enough sand to swallow Seth\u2019s feet. The place was boxed in by four walls and was wide enough to contain an entire cavalcade if they numbered no more than fifty men on their armored horses.</p>\n<p>Despite being built under a house, the place wasn\u2019t dark. There were magical orbs embedded in the walls. Each one length a clear orange glow with a touch of yellow. From what little Seth knew of magical objects, the orbs were infused with the mana of a certain species of fireflies. These fireflies had evolved after the first world crack and possessed orange mana that glowed about them. How it had been inculcated into the orbs was an entirely different conversation. Suffice to say, the glow from the orbs made it seem as if Seth and his brothers stood on an open plateau under the gaze of the evening sun.</p>\n<p>Jonathan stepped into the arena, relinquishing his place at the sidelines. He gave Seth the smallest reprieve from his training with Derek, and Seth felt his muscles sag in relief. His oldest brother was tall. He was almost twenty years of age. But while he was tall, his height wasn\u2019t anything special for a soul mage. Most soul mages\u2014males to be specific\u2014averaged around his brother\u2019s height well over six feet. The females, from the few Seth had seen, usually stood about two to three inches shorter. At thirteen years, Seth had to tilt his head back to see pretty much anyone. He was short for his age. Even his younger brother, Jeremy, was tall enough to face him at eye level, and the boy was just ten.</p>\n<p>Jonathan\u2019s height wasn\u2019t the only regal thing about him, though. His blonde hair was always cut to an acceptable medium length. It was kept short on both sides and was styled elegantly at the top. His odd royal amber eyes gave him a superior stare that he somehow managed to make look benevolent at the same time. Having him look at someone felt like having a benevolent king\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p>In summary, it was a sharp contrast to Seth\u2019s brown hair and brown eyes.</p>\n<p>As Jonathan approached him, Seth spared Derek a quiet glance and found his brother smirking. Like Jonathan, Derek had a presence. His eyes were a deep morning blue where Jonathan\u2019s were amber. He kept his dark blonde hair long and held back in a horse tail. He was also as tall as their brother. He carried himself regally just as well. However, where Jonathan resembled a benevolent king, Derek was an arrogant prince. He was the kind of prince who knew he looked good, knew he was powerful, and flaunted it like a skilled ballerina flaunts her twirls and pirouette. How he continued to attain fame and love with such arrogance was beyond Seth\u2019s understanding.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat you\u2019re supposed to learn today,\u201d Jonathan continued, a few steps away from Seth. \u201cIs that the spear is an extension of yourself, and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t I get a break?\u201d Seth interrupted him, then pointed the tip of his spear at Derek. \u201cI know you think he\u2019s holding back, and he probably is, but he\u2019s still silver. There\u2019s only so much I can do. And he keeps saying annoying things about Natalie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAn enemy won\u2019t be nice to you just because he\u2019s stronger.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the unsouled third son of House Darnesh won\u2019t be foolish enough to be caught fighting a soul mage, not to talk of one of silver authority.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know his problem?\u201d Derek chimed in. \u201cIt\u2019s that\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one cares, D,\u201d Seth cut him off.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014He\u2019s too eloquent,\u201d Derek finished without missing a beat. \u201cHe talks more when he should think more. How do you get riled up when someone insults some girl?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat girl is my best friend,\u201d Seth shot back, his anger rising again. \u201cAnd you stay away from her. I see the way you look at her. You\u2019re eighteen, and she just turned thirteen. This isn\u2019t one of Jonathan\u2019s old world medieval novels. In our time, you make a move on her and it\u2019s called child abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek laughed as if Seth had cracked a joke. \u201cAnd who\u2019ll arrest me?\u201d</p>\n<p>His words were enough to grab Jonathan\u2019s attention, and the oldest son of Lord Darnesh turned to him with a raised brow.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019ll arrest you?\u201d Jonathan asked, befuddled.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that,\u201d Derek sputtered.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t?\u201d Jonathan forgot Seth for a moment to attend their brother. \u201cRegale me then, D. How did you mean it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it any way.\u201d Derek stepped back as Jonathan took a step towards him.</p>\n<p>Seth fought to conceal his smile. He took his little pleasures where he could find them. Right now, he found it in the discomfort of his least favorite brother. He didn\u2019t hate Derek, but there was just some mutual dislike that existed between them. Their mother claimed it had simply been that way since the beginning. She speculated that Derek was simply a child unhappy at having lost his place and favor as the last born when Seth had been born. Seth saw it as no excuse. He was older than Jeremy with three years and never bullied him.</p>\n<p>Regardless, Seth\u2019s lips fought the urge to smile as he watched Derek stutter. A moment sooner, he was fighting over a different reason. A slow thrum of headache began growing at the back of his head and his lips pressed in a frown.</p>\n<p><em>Not this again, </em>he panicked. <em>Can\u2019t it just wait until I\u2019m in my room.</em></p>\n<p>His joy at watching Derek squirm under greater power was short-lived. Now, his attention was in the resistance of the building pain in his slowly aching head. As he fought it, resisted until it chose to be done with him, his brothers continued their exchange. They were oblivious, as always, to his pain.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d had this pain for as long as he could remember. It was a steady hum at the back of his head, like a muffled bee, buzzing and darting around behind an almost sound proof box. Sometimes it was bearable. But there were times, like now, when the bee found a way out of its box to buzz right inside his head. When it did, pain was always an accompaniment.</p>\n<p>Seth bit back his pain through clenched teeth as it rose to a crescendo. Gripping the side of his head in his right hand. He staggered back but refused to fall, holding on like a child for his dear life. Experience had taught him it would last a few minutes then leave him, but it didn\u2019t make those minutes any better.</p>\n<p>Slowly, Seth\u2019s jaw worked itself open in a voiceless cry. It was always the same; always painful; always refusing him the reprieve of crying out his pain. Silence, he\u2019d learned vastly too young for any person, was the worst way for any pain to be taken. It trapped the pain inside and embraced it to the point of madness. To cry out was to release some of it to the world beyond. But pain knew this and trapped itself within him. It was soundless and dominant in the breaking of his mind and the swallowing of his sense of self. His pain was his, and no one else\u2019s.</p>\n<p>It would not be shared, and it would not be ignored.</p>\n<p>When his spear clattered on the sand filled ground, his brothers turned to him. Seth couldn\u2019t see their expressions but knew Jonathan would be worried while Derek would be exhausted.</p>\n<p>In record time, Jonathan was at his side, silent as the dead. He rubbed gentle strokes along the length of Seth\u2019s back. He was a brother from time to time, and a benevolent one at that. His thumb eased circles that did nothing for Seth along his back. Seth pretended it helped whenever he had the presence of mind to. It was the least he could do for the kindness given. Today, his focus was entirely on his pain. He ignored Jonathan\u2019s actions and fought his pain.</p>\n<p>The training room waited in silence for the length of over five minutes, playing witness to Seth\u2019s silent suffering. Watching with the helplessness of winter\u2019s chill in autumn\u2019s reign. Eventually, the aegis of pain lifted. Seth found his mind belonged to him once more.</p>\n<p>The pain finally lessened. It did not die because it never did. Seth\u2019s reprieve from it was in the muffled buzzing it became. There was little pain, but the threat of it was always there. He lowered himself to sit in the sand and sobbed the tears his pain hadn\u2019t given him leave to shed in its presence. Jonathan, being the understanding brother that he was, allowed it for two minutes before speaking.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019s the arm?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>Seth didn\u2019t need to think about it. Jonathan asked of his weak arm, his left arm. The answer was clear. He turned to look at the spear. It lay in the sand where it had once been in his grasp. Beside him, the arm in question, his left arm, lay inert.</p>\n<p>It had abandoned him as it most often did. It was gone from his control, numb and lifeless.</p>\n<p>According to their parents, it was the result of a tragic incident that had happened to him as a child. It was a side effect to the headaches that now plagued him.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t you just <em>try </em>to hold it in,\u201d Derek said suddenly, tired. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s a headache. And every time you make it look like I\u2019m beating your head in.\u201d</p>\n<p>For whatever reason, his brother\u2019s opinion prevented him from noticing the look on Jonathan\u2019s face. There was a touch of anger in it, tainted with a touch of disgust. Derek was still talking when Jonathan got up. Derek failed to silence himself even as Jonathan left Seth to give him his undivided attention.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was understandable when you were small,\u201d Derek went on as Jonathan approached him, \u201cbut it\u2019s just pathetic now. You should have a handle on it by now. It\u2019s been what, eight years now? The least you can do is not be so dramatic about it. I know it hurts but learn to not make a scene about it. It\u2019s why Natalie\u2019s your only friend. No one likes a drama\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Jonathan drove his foot into Derek\u2019s chest and he shot across the hall. He crashed into one of the room\u2019s four walls. He made a hole in it, wedged into the crack in a rubble of broken concrete.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor someone not as eloquent as his younger brother, you talk too much,\u201d Jonathan said.</p>\n<p>Soul mages were a different breed of humans. In a world plagued by beasts and monsters for the last forty years, they were humans who\u2019d harnessed the power of these alien creatures to reach a realm beyond what had once been termed as natural. The more they strengthened this power, the higher their authority in it rose. This state of harnessed power was what it meant to be a soul mage.</p>\n<p>It was what it meant to be Souled.</p>\n<p>At Derek's authority, Jonathan\u2019s kick probably hurt Derek far more than the wall he\u2019d broken.</p>\n<p>Derek didn\u2019t hesitate to pull himself out of the broken wall with a frown. He stepped down, placing his feet on the floor so lightly it was a testament to his control. When he was out of its embrace, he looked at Jonathan angrily. He bent and picked up the spear that had fallen from his hold when he\u2019d hit the now broken wall. Something about the way he watched his older brother rubbed Seth the wrong way.</p>\n<p>\u201cCareful, brother,\u201d Jonathan warned. \u201cYou activate a skill here, and I can\u2019t promise your safety.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s knuckles whitened around the haft of his spear. He stared daggers at their brother. A tension built between both brothers and Seth scuttled back, increasing the distance between him and them.</p>\n<p>His father and mother had rules regarding their two older sons. For whatever reason they were to come to blows, they were not allowed to use the beautiful gift of skills being souled granted them. Unfortunately, down here, none of them were around to enforce this rule.</p>\n<p>Seth only prayed he wouldn\u2019t be a casualty to their chaos.</p>\n<p>When the altercation began, it was to a more than pathetic war cry from Derek. He hefted his spear in both hands. He stood against Jonathan\u2019s casual unarmed stance, and roared: \u201cFuck You!\u201d</p>\n<p>Then he activated a skill.</p>\n<p><strong>\u201c[Ice Guard].</strong><strong>\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>Seth watched the air around his brother tremble. It was a strange phenomenon that continued to awe him each time he witnessed it. In truth, it wasn\u2019t the air that trembled, it was more like watching the world move to his will. It was as if he called out his skill and the world somehow answered. A conclave of ice gathered to his free arm. Where there had once been nothing, a shield of pale blue ice as tall as three feet and as wide as two gathered to his arm.</p>\n<p>It was an inverted triangle that gleamed under the day colored lights of the hall. Its glossy exterior made it look as fancy as it was sturdy. The ice climbed up Derek\u2019s arm until it ended at his elbow, and he held his spear like a jousting lance.</p>\n<p>Jonathan watched his brother, unbothered.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s still not too late, D,\u201d he said with a sigh.</p>\n<p>Derek turned to the side and spat. His spittle hit the sand, bloodied. \u201cYou\u2019ll never take me seriously until I\u2019ve wiped your face with the floor.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jonathan frowned as if tired of a petulant child. \u201cAnd you never listen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s anger tightened and he activated another skill.</p>\n<p><strong>\u201c[Ice King].</strong><strong>\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>His second skill filled the air with lances of ice like stalactites in freezing winter. Each one gathered in the air behind him, forged from nothing, and he prepared himself. All twelve stalactites aimed at their brother and Jonathan shook his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Jonathan turned to Seth and shooed him further back with a gesture. \u201cDo endeavor to learn something from this,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Seth nodded, scooting further back and abandoning his spear.</p>\n<p>When the first ice spear shot from its place above Derek, Seth didn\u2019t see it. All he saw was one less spear of ice. One moment there were twelve spikes of ice and the next moment Jonathan was shattering it in his grasp. The action was so casual it would\u2019ve been easy to believe the attack had been weak. Seth knew better.</p>\n<p>Jonathan took a step forward shaking loose residue of ice from his hand. He looked at Derek for a moment. His face was a mask of contemplation. It lasted briefly before he sighed. It was resigned. \u201cMy turn,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p><strong>\u201c[Hearth of Fire].</strong><strong>\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>Jonathan\u2019s skill came alive. The world grew hot around him and the air burned. A crack appeared in Derek\u2019s shield.</p>\n<p>Seth would have braced himself against the heat if he could but he couldn\u2019t. Instead, he fainted.</p>\n<p>In the nothingness of the unconscious, something whispered without words.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>[You Have Been Stunned].</strong></p>\n            </div>",

        "chapter_content": "<div class=\"chapter-inner chapter-content\">\n                <p>When Ezril was seven, he\u2019d once asked the gate keeper, Eln, what it took to become a great warrior. The head gate keeper\u2019s words had been simple: \u201cIt is neither swords nor spears nor armors or shield. It is skill, and determination. Courage\u2026 and the great favor of Truth.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eln\u2019s words had stayed with Ezril longer than he had expected it to, but not for the reasons many would believe. No. The reason was because while it was not the first time an adult had done their best to sound sage and wise in front of him, it was the first time he had heard doubt and hesitation in an adult\u2019s voice when speaking of Truth.</p>\n<p>As children, the catechism always taught that Truth was the greatest, the one true god standing above all else. His existence was paramount and without question. He led men to victory and gave the kingdom of Alduin the gift of the Hallowed. Without him, there would be no kingdom; no realm.</p>\n<p>Without him, there would be no protection from the sinister malevolence of the Tainted and their magic. There would be no Hallowed strong enough to stand against magic. Truth had given them this in the name of his priests.</p>\n<p>So Eln\u2019s words stayed with Ezril for years longer than it was intended to, not for \u2018courage\u2019 or \u2018determination\u2019 or \u2018skill\u2019 but because it was the first time he realized that adults existed who did not believe entirely that their existence was with the grace of Truth.</p>\n<p>Eln was the first man to hesitate to give Truth credit.</p>\n<p>As Ezril grew older, he understood better. However, while he understood the human confidence of wanting to claim glory for every victory achieved, he did not understand the courage and determination to deny Truth the glory he was due.</p>\n<p>Now he was ten and sitting next to a gutter that smelled of age old detritus and something dead in the destitute parts of the city that was called the underbelly. Judging by the stench of it, Ezril was more than certain human excrement was part of the contents of the gutter.</p>\n<p>Already accustomed to the smell, he turned his attention from his sense of smell and returned it to the game in front of him.</p>\n<p>Splayed out on the sandy ground was a game of netti. A set of pebbles arranged in no obvious pattern stared back at him, waiting and hoping. Around Ezril three boys laughed and bickered. Their entertainment created as much disturbance as it could. Each one was poorly dressed. One was dressed so poorly that he had no shirt with which to cover his torso.</p>\n<p>The boys did not bicker and laugh for the sake of one entertainment or the other. Their entertainment and enjoyment played a part in it but not its entirety. Their true goal was in Ezril\u2019s disturbance.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo on, then,\u201d Alphons mocked, voice teasing. \u201cShow us what Lenaria taught you before she left.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ezril ignored the boy as he tried to focus on his concentration. The game of netti was not popular on his side of city. Where Ezril lived, the children were more civilized, better dressed. They played more civilized games like the old game of war the scribes and scholars that played a part in guiding the kingdom and advising the king favored.</p>\n<p>Here, in the back waters of the small city of Green Horn, one of the lands under the purview of the Baron of the Deep, they played netti. And they enjoyed it.</p>\n<p>Ezril rolled the few pebbles in his small hand. He counted four in total, his usual limit. At four pebbles, his hand was full, comfortably so. Still, he knew he could fit a few more pebbles in it. But that wasn\u2019t the problem. How many pebbles he could hold in his hand was only a small portion of the games difficulty. The greater portion was how many more he could add to their numbers.</p>\n<p>Netti was a game that could be played alone or with multiple players. All that was required to play it was a significant number of pebbles and a player. Its aim was in how many pebbles could be gathered in the player\u2019s one hand before one slipped and fell. The difficulty was in the fact that only one hand was allowed to be used in the game. Nothing else.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019s burning daylight,\u201d Alphons frowned. \u201cLenaria played better than this. We\u2019s thought you was her legacy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ezril fought his frown at the continued mention of Lenaria and made his move. He tossed all four pebbles in his hand up. He did his best to calculate where each one went and how high they soared as his hand reached down into the sand. He snatched one of the tiny pebbles, quick and efficient. He fought a grimace as sand got under his nails.</p>\n<p>The pebbles he\u2019d tossed were falling now, each one falling in its own place. Lenaria was the only one who played the game this way. The other children played it safer. They kept their pebbles in their hand as they reached down to claim the ones in the sand. It was safe and efficient against Lenaria\u2019s reckless technique. It was also slow.</p>\n<p>Ezril\u2019s eyes snapped to another pebble. One in hand, he had the time to garner another before he would be hard pressed to catch the ones that he\u2019d tossed. So he took his chance and snatched at another pebble.</p>\n<p>Fren, the smallest of the group, shirtless and happy, chose that moment to cough. It was the simplest sound, small, withheld, even. But it was enough to break Ezril\u2019s focus. Ezril\u2019s fingers grazed the second pebble but failed to snatch it. Where Fren\u2019s cough had broken Ezril\u2019s focus, missing the pebble had broken his confidence. Ezril found himself scrambling after his now falling pebbles.</p>\n<p>His hand moved, quick as the wind. His left hand, free and exempt from the game, twitched in a barely restrained urge to aid him. He kept it there with nothing but his will, honed over three years of playing netti. He snatched the lowest falling pebble. He caught it a quick moment before it struck the sand and his hand climbed upwards. It snatched each pebble from the air.</p>\n<p>Ezril reached for another falling pebble and closed around nothing, missing it. He tried not to let it bother him as his hand continued its upward trajectory. He allowed it snatch the next in line before pulling it down, sending it after its missed target. The hand shot down, three pebbles hidden within its embrace and reached for the missed pebble before it hit the ground.</p>\n<p>His fingers sucked it into the comfort of his fist a moment before his play mates erupted in a chorus of satisfied cheers.</p>\n<p>Ezril\u2019s lips pressed in a thin line as the last pebble hit the ground. It was soundless in the cushion of sand. As much as he liked to think he had been close, he had not been. He knew his problem had begun from the moment he\u2019d failed to snatch up the second pebble. In fact, he knew he shouldn\u2019t have gone for daring accomplishments with five pebbles in the air, but he hadn\u2019t been able to stop himself. The chance had been right there. His success would\u2019ve beat his own record, tied him with the second highest record in their small rag-tag group.</p>\n<p><em>You were greedy, </em>he told himself. <em>Should\u2019ve planned it better, waited it out.</em></p>\n<p>Ezril let out a defeated sigh as he released the pebbles in his hand and sat down in the sand.</p>\n<p>\u201cClose,\u201d Alphons commended. \u201cBut not close enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ezril looked at the boy with a satisfied smirk. Despite the loss of having failed to beat his own record, the game had still been fun.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd how many are you at?\u201d Ezril asked, smiling.</p>\n<p>Alphons smirked. \u201cTen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ezril\u2019s smile slipped from his face. \u201cTen!\u201d</p>\n<p>He refused to believe Alphons had beaten Dorni\u2019s record. But when? The last time they had played, Alphons was still holding the record of seven pebbles to Dorni\u2019s nine pebbles. Alphons held the rank of second to Dorni\u2019s first.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen did you get to ten?\u201d Ezril asked, still in shock.</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo days ago?\u201d Fren answered, his voice as small as his size.</p>\n<p>Ezril turned to him. \u201cTwo days ago?\u201d he asked, wondering where he\u2019d been while Alphons was increasing the gap in their accomplishments. \u201cTwo days ago was Frostiff so\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you were in church,\u201d Dorni finished for him.</p>\n<p>Dorni was the largest of the group even if not by a significant margin. He had the characteristic brown eyes of any Alduin. He had soft wiry hair and a crooked nose he\u2019d gotten from a fight he\u2019d been in at an age when Ezril still couldn\u2019t leave the house alone. He\u2019d broken his nose in the fight. Being from the back alleys with no one to care for him, he\u2019d received no proper treatment. Without setting the nose right, it had healed poorly.</p>\n<p>Still, it gave the boy a deadly look.</p>\n<p>Ezril turned his attention to Dorni. \u201cYou say that like it\u2019s a bad thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dorni responded with a shrug.</p>\n<p>\u201cI got nothing against worshipping Truth,\u201d he said, scattering the pebbles in the sand, distancing them from each other so that they were harder to reach but not too difficult as to be impossible. \u201cBut I don\u2019t likes the church.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was only one church of Truth in the entire city so there was no mistaking which church he was talking about.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Fren agreed. \u201cSisters there don\u2019t let us in. An\u2019 when we try to takes the food, they chase us away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s cause you\u2019s always looks like one of the Broken whenever we go,\u201d Alphons joked. \u201cWith big eyes and tiny lips.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy eyes is not big,\u201d Fren argued, narrowing his lids to reduce the size of his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey are kinda big,\u201d Ezril joked. \u201cI mean, you could probably look up and see Truth from way down here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alphons and Dorni laughed. The sound was unrestrained and buttressed the jibe.</p>\n<p>Fren frowned but took the jokes in strides. He didn\u2019t complain. He\u2019d given worse than this on many occasions, after all.</p>\n<p>Ezril had learned earlier on that it was the way with this group. When Lenaria had still been around, before she\u2019d gone and found a good man to adopt her and take her from this city, she\u2019d been a part of this. She joked as easily, exchanging banter with the rest of them. It was hard to use words that displeased her enough to cause a problem. And while there were times when she would get angry, times when she would stomp off, she never spent more than a day angry with them.</p>\n<p>Dorni, Alphons and Fren thought she was odd for a girl. As for Ezril, he thought they were all odd children. Then again, he didn\u2019t know a lot of people who lived in the city\u2019s underbelly and got into fights that broke their noses at the young age of eight. Where he lived, children made sure to wait until they were fifteen and receiving some kind of weapons training from the gate keepers before they got into any serious fight.</p>\n<p>That said, he doubted he would\u2019ve really spent much time with them if he\u2019d never met Lenaria on that fateful night years ago. And he knew he wouldn\u2019t have remained their friend after Lenaria had gone if that fateful night hadn\u2019t left most of the kids he knew giving him odd looks and quiet mumbles. There was a standing mystery in the city surrounded by the deaths of four men and fire that burned black as night. Ezril and Lenaria stood at the heart of this mystery. While Ezril had explained what had happened to the head gate keeper already, he knew there were still many who didn\u2019t believe his story.</p>\n<p>So while the adults were too nice and favored his aunt Teneri too much to turn away from Ezril, the kids had no such discipline. On the bright side, it kept them from being mean to him. On the dark side, being feared and wary of was a good way to be made a pariah. He knew there were rumors about him. What he still didn\u2019t know till this day was what they were.</p>\n<p>Ezril, as aunt Teneri had always advised, tried not to let it get to him. But he\u2019d be lying if he said it didn\u2019t. At least in the underbelly Alphons, Dorni and Fren didn\u2019t fear him. They didn\u2019t whisper and watch him in half-hidden fear.</p>\n<p>The sun was dipping into the horizon now. It\u2019s once yellow glow was now a deep orange. Evening had come a while back and everyone had ignored it, now night was drawing nigh. At ten years of age, Ezril could ignore the evening but not the night.</p>\n<p>It was confusing enough that aunt Teneri always allowed him spend so much time outside the house. His mates had no such freedom as the one he had. At least not the ones in the main city. Out here in the underbelly, the children had more freedom than him. Unlike his, however, their freedom came with no one to protect them.</p>\n<p>Ezril got up from the sandy ground and dusted the shorts he wore. His hands came away sandy. While he was satisfied with his brief clean up, he knew his shorts were anything but clean.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019s can\u2019t stay a little longer?\u201d Alphons asked him. \u201cSenam says the king\u2019s guards will be passing by midnight. We\u2019s plannin\u2019 on headin\u2019 to the gate to have a look see. If you stay out long enough, you might get to sees them with us.\u201d</p>\n<p>The boy\u2019s alduin was terrible but Ezril held nothing of it against him. He never had and never would. Most of the children of the underbelly were self-taught, after all. To expect perfection from them in literacy was to expect a Tainted to stop using magic: it was possible but unreasonable.</p>\n<p>Alphons\u2019 news was tempting. Here in their city, located on the edge of the Alduin kingdom, no one ever got to see the king\u2019s guards. They were the only soldiers in the kingdom rumored to be capable of matching priests of Truth in equal deadliness.</p>\n<p>The priests fought in the name of Truth. They often worked under the guidance of the Priestesses and sisters who governed the church of Truth. They sought out their own agenda, usually, giving aid to the kingdom when it was in need, often times refusing without punishment. Mostly, they only marched in numbers for wars they deemed as crusades. They moved when the problems were a threat to the Credo. The king\u2019s guards, however, answered only to the king, and he sent them where problems were believed to be direst.</p>\n<p>The priests of Truth fought the Tainted and their magic in protection of the Credo while the king\u2019s guards fought them in protection of the kingdom.</p>\n<p>If they were passing this far out at the edge of the kingdom, then perhaps the rumors of war to the north were true.</p>\n<p>Ezril didn\u2019t like the feeling it gave him.</p>\n<p>Dorni and the others were children who lived their lives as best they could by their own rules. They didn\u2019t spend much time amongst a lot of the adults so they rarely heard of the worries whispered in full families and by parents who believed they had a lot to lose. But Ezril did, and he understood enough to know that if the rumors of war were true, it wouldn\u2019t go well for the city. The soldiers would make a fort of this place and it would be reduced to a battle ground.</p>\n<p>Ezril shook his head at the thought of war and it sufficed to sour whatever little excitement he\u2019d gotten from the idea of seeing the king\u2019s guards.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what,\u201d he said, making up his mind. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll see them another time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cScaredy cat,\u201d Alphons snorted.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared,\u201d Ezril said, unfazed by the boy\u2019s goading. \u201cI\u2019m obedient. There\u2019s a difference. I have to be home before dark.\u201d</p>\n<p>He cast his gaze in the direction of the setting sun and worried he wouldn\u2019t make it back home on time. By the time he got home, it would be nightfall.</p>\n<p><em>Aunt Teneri won\u2019t be happy.</em></p>\n<p>Ezril turned away from his friends. He waved them a simple goodbye and made his way back to the more reputable part of the city. Back to the people he found boring but clean.</p>\n<p>\u201cBring back a spare shirt for me!\u201d Fren called after him as he left.</p>\n<p>Ezril nodded in response as he ran, wondering if he still had any clothes that would fit the small boy. He\u2019d already given the boy all the clothes he owned and had outgrown. Sometimes he wondered what exactly the boy did with them, because every time they all met Fren never had a shirt on and his pants were always in a horrible state.</p>\n<p>Ezril bounded through the alleys. He slipped his way between buildings and crept out into the open city of clean roads and clean houses. It was already night and dark by the time he arrived at the heart of Green Horn.</p>\n<p>The roads here were made of cobble stones where the underbelly had only sand and dust. While the roads were growing steadily empty at this time when everyone had made their way home, it was usually busy with people and horses. During the day it was as loud as a busy city could get and just as active.</p>\n<p>Ezril took a turn down Silver Lane. He followed down the sidewalk with hurried steps. His eyes darting about in the darkness. He had returned to the city but he still wasn\u2019t too far off from the underbelly, so safety wasn\u2019t entirely guaranteed. Halfway down Silver Lane, he crossed the empty roads, made his way to the other side and slipped through another alley, a small gap between two buildings.</p>\n<p>Aunt Teneri would be worried by his tardiness, and he wasn\u2019t a fan of making her worry so he hurried his steps. In her old age aunt Teneri had made a case of him returning home early today. She told him something about an important guest he was supposed to meet and here he was, coming at nightfall. As an only child she cared for him. She was kind but not overly so. She made physical contact only when necessary. She wasn\u2019t one to tuck him in bed or give him a kiss on the head. But she was kind and made sure he never lacked anything. Sometimes, on rare occasions such as when he cried, she would make an exception and hold him. She would make calming sounds and give gentle promises until he had no more tears to shed.</p>\n<p>As an orphan who knew nothing of his mother and carried the only memory of his father in the form of a red, right hand, aunt Teneri was the oldest family he knew. Sadly, she wasn\u2019t related to him biologically. He knew this as he knew he was ten. How? Because she\u2019d told him.</p>\n<p>Most people in the city claimed she\u2019d come in with him when he was barely five, holding his hand as they walked past the city gates. Where they came from was a mystery to everyone as well as Ezril. What had led them here was equally so.</p>\n<p>As a form of respect to aunt Teneri for all the care she had given him, Ezril did his best to never ask of his parents. He\u2019d asked on a few occasions growing up, though. Who was his father? What happened to his mother? How did she come to be the one caring for him? Why did she never want him to call her mother?</p>\n<p>The last question was born more from confusion than true curiosity. Aunt Teneri had taken care of him all his life. Ezril had no memory where she was not present. In each one, she could be found playing a motherly role, always with an easy smile or a loving scowl. To him, she was a mother in all but name, and she seemed to take it quite literally.</p>\n<p>Ezril\u2019s mind wandered to other subjects as he drew closer to his home. The silence of the dark night was a welcome companion to his thoughts. He passed the resident church of Truth, the only one the small city had. As much as he believed in Truth, he couldn\u2019t say he was a devout believer. For him, Truth was like his biological mother, a concept that simply existed. He\u2019d never known his mother, had no memories of her, even, but everyone told him he\u2019d had one. He could no sooner stop himself from believing he had a mother once than he could stop himself from believing Truth was real. This was the work of society; to mold a child into a being of their choice, to ingrain certain concepts until to doubt such a concept was anathema even to the child\u2019s mind.</p>\n<p>Truth was real to Ezril because everyone claimed he was real. It was no more than that, and no less.</p>\n<p>Ezril wondered at the concept of the king\u2019s guards as he passed the church. They would definitely be a sight to behold. Eln had worked alongside them once during his mercenary days and he always spoke of them with awe and respect. Their armors of leather and fine clothing were a crimson red that put blood to shame. Their insignia of crossed swords through a skull\u2019s eyes was meant to be terrifying and strong.</p>\n<p>Each man and woman of the king\u2019s guard was blessed by Truth, given the strength of a Hallowed body the king went the extra mile to hone greatly. They were\u2014according to rumors\u2014the only people in the kingdom besides priests equipped well enough to stand against the scourge of the Tainted.</p>\n<p>They would truly be a sight to behold. However, they were not so grand that Ezril would stay so late and give aunt Teneri a head ache over. A priest of Truth, however, was different. Or even Aemond, the kingdom\u2019s hero. Those were sights people went an entire lifetime without seeing. Aemond was even a rarer sight than priests. Rumors had it the king sent him out to protect the kingdom from the threat of nin beasts too strong and dangerous for even platoons of soldiers, or to hunt down the Tainted and the Scorned who\u2019d lived for too long and had grown too powerful.</p>\n<p>But despite Aemond\u2019s fame, Ezril found that he was more interested in priests.</p>\n<p>The sisters of the church were often called the right hands of Truth. He showed benevolence with them, the love of a father and the compassion of a mother. With priests, however, he held wrath in his left hand. They were the weapons with which he smote the heretic and severed the Scorned and Tainted from their magic and their lives.</p>\n<p>A sister of the church was respected. For a priest of Truth, respect was a lie hidden in the veil of half-bows and downturned eyes. No. For priests there was no respect, only fear. And reasonably so.</p>\n<p>So when Ezril made his last turn and jogged his way up the last path that led to his home, he was considerably justified when he froze at the sight of the man standing in front of his home. The man had hair so grey it was almost white and he stood watching Ezril with expressionless eyes.</p>\n<p>Ezril bowed his head on no more guidance than instinct. His legs froze beneath him and carried him no further.</p>\n<p>After all, what was a child to do when faced with a man of the frock? What was a child to do when a priest of Truth stood between them and their home?</p>\n            </div>",

        "chapter_content": "<div class=\"chapter-inner chapter-content\">\n                <p>\u201cThe gods are bastards.\u201d</p>\n<p>The scene of the death was quite beautiful, now, years after the fact. A small creek cut through a little hollow in the prairie; the bowl-shaped depression had probably been a crater centuries ago before rain and wind had blunted its edges and nature filled it with field grasses and singing cicadas. In the exact center, in a vaguely star-shaped swath of emerald green moss interrupting the golden tallgrass, stood a stone marker bearing the carved sunburst of Omnu, the victim\u2019s name and the dates bracketing her pitifully short life.</p>\n<p>She knelt before the tiny monument, apparently studying it but in truth merely listening as he approached. The crunch of his boots, the rattle of spurs had given him away long before he spoke, to her annoyance; his heavy tread obscured the other sounds for which she listened.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can feel free to tell Father Reyfield I said so,\u201d the man went on, coming to a stop at the lip of the little crater. His shadow loomed beside her, an elongated figure in a ten-gallon hat, hands tucked into his belt in the stationary swagger of a man who kept order in his little town by the sheer force of his personality. \u201cThe old poof and I don\u2019t see eye-to-eye on much anyway. Here\u2019s little June Witwill, just plain the <em>best</em> girl in the province, near enough. Sang in the choir, donated all her pocket money to the local mission\u2026 Always spoke respectfully of Emperor and country, and up to her eyes in everything ever went on at the church. She once got caught up in a stagecoach robbery when she was twelve, and talked one of the bandits into turning himself in. He went on to become a monk in Omnu\u2019s temple, used to send June letters all the time.\u201d The shadow of his hat oscillated as he shook his head slowly. \u201cJust\u2026best kid I ever knew, is all. And here she is, walkin\u2019 out to catch crawdads in the stream, and just\u2026burns. Just went up like a goddamn firework. Town\u2019s almost a mile away and we heard her scream like it was happening right there. What the hell kind of thing is that, except an act of the gods? And why the hell would they wanna pick on one of the sweetest things they ever created? Yeah, I ain\u2019t been to church since. They\u2019re just plain bastards, is all, and I\u2019ve got enough of those comin\u2019 through my town as it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>His steps resumed crunching in the dry grass, more loudly as he picked his way down the slope toward her. The woman rose slowly to her feet, pausing to brush off the knees of her trousers. For a moment she considered getting one of those hats, just for comfort\u2019s sake, but her eyes didn\u2019t need protection from the sun. Besides, she liked the way it gleamed on her golden hair. There was always time for a little touch of vanity.</p>\n<p>\u201cI doubt you can imagine what that did to a little town like this, where everybody knows everybody and their business,\u201d he said, drawing abreast of her. \u201cAnd now, three years on, just when it\u2019s all starting to finally scab over, here comes some nosy elf with a big-city accent, snooping around, asking questions about poor June Witwill and generally opening old wounds. This town doesn\u2019t need that kinda grief, and the Witwills sure as hell don\u2019t. Ma\u2019am, I can\u2019t honestly imagine what it is you\u2019re after, and I do not care. Speakin\u2019 with the full authority of my office, this is me tellin\u2019 you to knock it off. Coach leaves for the Rail depot at Saddle Ridge tomorrow at nine sharp. I think you oughta be on it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWish you hadn\u2019t followed me, Marshal,\u201d she murmured without looking up at him.</p>\n<p>He grunted. \u201cJust bet you do. Now, are we gonna have any difficulty over it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThree and a half years ago, in various places across the Empire, four girls between the ages of fourteen and nineteen spontaneously combusted.\u201d She began pacing in a slow circle around the mossy area, peering at the ground. The swath of green was decorated here and there with tiny stands of <em>versithorae</em>, conical flowers in brilliant shades of yellow, orange and crimson. Elf candles, the human settlers called them. They grew only in the aftermath of fire, where ash nourished the soil. \u201cWell, \u2018combusted\u2019 might give the wrong impression; they went up like bombs. All four on the same day, and though the records aren\u2019t precise enough to verify it, I\u2019d bet my ears at the very same moment. And I should clarify that four is merely the number of cases I\u2019ve verified of so far. I\u2019m almost positive there were others. I first learned of this after meeting the one girl who lived, who\u2019s to start in my class this fall.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cClass?\u201d He eyed her up and down, from sweat-stained work shirt to dusty leggings and scuffed snakeskin boots. \u201cYou\u2019re a schoolteacher?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProfessor,\u201d she corrected absently, still circling. \u201cI\u2019ve found no common thread between them at all, except that each was struck down while she was alone, isolated, outdoors and a good distance from any town. In Shiver Gulch, a mining town in Calderaan Province, it was a sixteen-year-old who\u2019d been in and out of more trouble than a privateer on shore leave. She was passing through a graveyard on the way to join a few other ne\u2019er-do-wells who were waiting with a bottle of whiskey and a whole <em>bushel</em> of glittershrooms. You know how the kids are. It was they who ran for help after hearing her scream, and seeing the fire.\u201d</p>\n<p>She straightened, stretching her neck, and met his eyes for the first time. He watched her warily, as he might a large prowling dog of uncertain intentions. Then she resumed her pacing, staring at the moss. \u201cIn a wealthy village less than forty miles from the Imperial capital itself, it was a poorly-closeted lesbian roaming the backroads to hide from the town bullies. She was struck down as she crossed a footbridge, and fell into a creek, which was vaporized on contact. In Lasa Vallas, another frontier town much like this one, it was a studious young lady of good parenting who worked at the local library and volunteered her time at a stable. Loved animals, and reading. It hit her as she walked across open prairie to the nearby elf grove to return a book she\u2019d borrowed from one of the druids.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich one survived?\u201d he asked quietly. She glanced at him again, noting with wry satisfaction that the bluster had leaked from him entirely, leaving only a fairly young man trying to accept responsibility for his whole narrow world, under pressures he couldn\u2019t begin to understand.</p>\n<p>She came to a halt again in front of the memorial to poor June Witwill, whose faith had not saved her. \u201cIt\u2019s never the one you\u2019d expect,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThe unfortunate Miss Witwill was attacked by a demon, Marshal. An extremely high-ranking demon, several orders of magnitude more powerful than any seen on the physical plane before. It attempted to possess her, but a human body proved a wholly inadequate host, resulting in the destruction of the girl and, luckily, the creature. We know this because the survivor was able to integrate the demon into herself, preserving both.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re letting a girl possessed by a <em>demon</em> into your class?\u201d he said incredulously.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe situation is complicated. It\u2019s unfathomably complicated, and that\u2019s just the fairly small slice of it that I understand. The Church and the Empire have both been involved in this, but I don\u2019t trust either to investigate their own butts using both hands and a mirror, especially not when they begin tripping each other up. So I\u2019m after my own answers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, well\u2026nobody in this town has your answers, Professor Elf. It was crawling with priests and Imperial agents for a full year after the incident. If they didn\u2019t turn up anything when the scene was fresh, you won\u2019t now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, but I doubt the investigators thought to ask the Black Wreath.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe <em>who?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cThe Black Wreath,\u201d she said patiently. \u201cA cult dedicated to Elilial. They\u2019re secretive, mostly masquerading as\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>know </em>who the Black Wreath are, lady! That\u2019s something else you\u2019re not gonna find in this town. Business like that goes on in the cities, not out her among ranchers and farmers who don\u2019t have <em>time </em>for demon-worship even if they have the inclination.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wordlessly, she pointed upward.</p>\n<p>Raising his eyes, the Marshal started violently, cursing. The rim of the crater was ringed by figures in hooded ash-gray robes; nine of them, almost encircling the two below. He snatched up the two wands holstered at his belt, aiming each up at the menacing figures. Beside him, the Professor rolled her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right, that\u2019s close enough,\u201d the Marshal snapped, grasping for control of the situation. \u201cWe\u2019re all neighbors here; nobody needs to get zapped. Let\u2019s lose those hoods. Slowly, now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is why I wish you hadn\u2019t followed me,\u201d said the elf mildly. \u201cNow I have to keep <em>you</em> alive, too.\u201d He spared her a withering sidelong glare.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry about this, Marshal,\u201d said one, his voice muffled. \u201cAlways did like you, but you\u2019re in the wrong place at the worst possible time. The elf needs to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know how tricky it is to ask <em>exactly </em>the right questions make it plain you already know to much when you don\u2019t know anything?\u201d the Professor asked idly, pitching her voice low. \u201cThe first two towns had no significant Wreath presence; the third one, I let slip who I was and spooked them into running. I\u2019ve worked hard on this trap, Marshal, and I have no more leads, so kindly don\u2019t screw it up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right, enough!\u201d the Marshal shouted, raising both wands higher; he was beginning to look rather frazzled. \u201cHoods off, hands where I can see them. <em>Now!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Four of the cultists moved, including the speaker, but they reached into their robes, not for their hoods. The Marshal cursed and squeezed the switches on both his wands; their muted <em>click</em> was lost in a tremendous <em>CRACK</em> as bolts of lightning sprang from the tips, striking down two of the robed figures. Not fast enough; the two others had pulled wands from their hiding places and returned fire.</p>\n<p>Lightning bolts fizzed into nothingness a few feet from the two in the crater, prompting oaths of surprise from above.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Do </em>try not to kill them all,\u201d said the Professor, then bent her legs slightly and leaped fifty feet straight up, somersaulting over the heads of the startled cultists to land gracefully in the tallgrass beyond the depression. She gestured with both hands and two more of them went bowling cowl-over-spurs into the depression.</p>\n<p>Except for the speaker, who stood at the lip of the crater as if frozen, the rest scattered.</p>\n<p>The Professor strode unhurriedly after them; by the time the Marshal had dragged himself up from below, she had pinned two more down under a mass of what looked like giant spiderwebs and felled a third with another invisible bolt of force. He paused at the rim, aiming both wands at the immobile cultist.</p>\n<p>\u201cLeave him be, he\u2019s not going anywhere,\u201d the elf called over her shoulder from up ahead. \u201cThat one seemed most likely to have useful information, so I fixed him in time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFixed him in\u2026\u201d He tore his gaze from the pacified cultist to her, then broke off what he\u2019d been about to say. \u201cWatch out!\u201d</p>\n<p>A dozen yards beyond her, the sole remaining robed figure had doubled over, almost hidden by the waving grass. Now his robe began to ripple as though blown in a high wind. He let out a low groan which grew rapidly into an ear-splitting shriek, then with a great ripping of fabric and flesh, seemed to explode, blood splattering the grass around him.</p>\n<p>From the ruins of the cultist rose a bronze colossus, draped in scraps of gray cloth and grisly scraps of the cultist. Spiny wings sprang from its shoulders; it was proportioned like a gorilla, with stubby legs and hugely powerful arms, and covered in coppery scales that gleamed blindingly in the prairie sun. Lacking a neck, its lump of a head sprouted directly from its torso, with a gaping mouth extending halfway down its chest.</p>\n<p>The creature weakly fluttered its wings once, swiveled its whole body back and forth as though looking for something, then fixed its gaze on the Professor and emitted a howl was more than half a roar.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, fuck me,\u201d groaned the Marshal.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm,\u201d said the Professor. \u201cThis complicates matters.\u201d</p>\n<p>Not waiting for any further commentary, he raised both wands and mashed the switches, unleashing blast after blast of lightning directly at the monstrosity. It roared in fury, but gave no sign of falling; the magic bolts left swaths of scorched prairie grass in their wake but splashed harmlessly across the creature\u2019s hide. Still, he pressed forward, giving it everything he had, until the elf tackled him from the side, pushing them both into the ground.</p>\n<p>Seconds later, the Marshal had only just raised his head and spat out a mouthful of loam when the earth shook as the monster ran right past them, howling. He froze, the elf\u2019s meager weight half on top of him; one of the creature\u2019s bronze feet went by so close he could have reached out to grab it. But they were hidden by the tallgrass, apparently; he could hear the brute stomping and roaring in frustration a few feet away, seeking his lost prey.</p>\n<p>It occurred to the Marshal that the thing couldn\u2019t be very bright. Not that that would help anyone if it went for the town.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a baerzurg,\u201d the elf breathed in his ear. \u201cA lesser class of demon, but its skin is quite impervious. You\u2019ll only draw its attention with your wands. Stay put a moment.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then she was gone.</p>\n<p>For a tense moment the only sounds were of the demon\u2019s snorting and snuffling (could it smell him?), then suddenly the Professor\u2019s voice came from several feet away.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey there, handsome!\u201d</p>\n<p>There was another roar and the pounding of heavy feet, followed by a light laugh from the elf. \u201cOooh, so close! Go on, have another try.\u201d</p>\n<p>She continued to taunt the creature, leading it progressively further from the Marshal, the Witwill memorial and the town which was just barely visible in the distance. As the sounds of her laughing and the creature\u2019s increasingly frustrated yowls drew farther away, he carefully rose to a crouch, removing his hat and peeking up through the upper fronds of the grass. He could barely make out the flicker of movement that was the elf, but the demon continued to stomp back and forth after her, roaring.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you seeing what I\u2019m seeing?\u201d</p>\n<p>He cursed and almost threw himself flat again at her voice, which came from just behind his shoulder. She winked at him from inches away.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2026you\u2026over there\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIllusory decoy,\u201d she explained. \u201cNow, Marshal, don\u2019t lose your head. Anyhow, it looks like we\u2019re in luck. Our boy\u2019s a slugger, not a caster.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I\u2019m just gonna sit here and wait for everything to make sense again,\u201d he said woodenly.</p>\n<p><a name=\"query_h1\" rel=\" ugc nofollow\"></a> \u201cOh, relax. Baerzurg are hierarchal; some of the upper castes are quite smart and can use magic, but this one\u2019s clearly nothing but muscle. Easily dealt with.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Easily?</em> That thing looks like it could demolish a building!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019d best not lead him near any buildings then, eh? Now keep your head down, I\u2019m going to coax him back this way\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>She crouched, peering at her duplicate through narrowed eyes and making twitching motions with her fingers. The Marshal groaned softly and edged over to give her space. He watched, clutching his wands for comfort, as the laughing decoy began to weave back in their direction, dragging the increasingly furious demon along.</p>\n<p>The illusion finally came to a dead stop, waving cheerily at the baerzurg. Sensing its chance, the beast pounced on her, roaring in triumph. It turned to a howl of impotent rage when the figure vanished right under him.</p>\n<p>The Professor stood and calmly made a lifting motion with her hand. The baerzurg, which had been snuffling about on the ground, trying to locate his lost target, yelped as he suddenly ascended straight into the air.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can come out, Marshal,\u201d she called. \u201cIt\u2019s quite safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Slowly, he rose to his feet. The demon hung suspended twenty feet in the air, roaring and swiping at the elf, who stood almost underneath him, well beyond his reach.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll need to concentrate on this bit,\u201d she said cheerily, \u201cso kindly busy yourself elsewhere. Perhaps you could round up the rest of our visitors? Here.\u201d She handed him a sizable coil of slim, silvery rope which she had definitely not been holding a moment before.</p>\n<p>The Marshal did as he was told. At least it was something he understood.</p>\n<p>No matter how he steeled himself, each face he uncovered was a punch to the gut. The lone cultist who\u2019d been the last one felled by one of the elf\u2019s blasts was Howard Slater, a jovial, pot-bellied man who ran the town\u2019s general store. He had passed many a slow hour in the hot afternoons gossiping with the Marshal, and everyone else in the town. The man had a strong pulse and was breathing, but showed no signs of waking up. Whatever she\u2019d hit him with was well-designed.</p>\n<p>He had to use his jackknife to extract the two under the spiderwebs, and even so they were left covered with a sticky mess that he didn\u2019t bother to try removing. Maggie Vinterson was a spinster with a mouth like a prune who was always nose-deep in everyone\u2019s private affairs; Lorenzo Haltas worked at the scrolltower office. By all the gods, the man trusted with every message beamed into and out of the town was a demon worshiper. The Marshal almost dizzied himself trying to recall whether anything he\u2019d sent to the capital in the last year would have been of interest to cultists before forcing himself to drop that futile line of thinking. He lined them up next to Slater, lashing their ankles and wrists together and to each other; they\u2019d not be going anywhere when they woke.</p>\n<p>He glanced over at the Professor for a moment. She was still standing beneath the imprisoned demon, staring fixedly up at it; now the beast\u2019s distracting howls had taken on a desperate tone and it had begun writhing in apparent pain. At this rate, wouldn\u2019t be long before someone came from town to investigate the commotion; sound carried a long way over the prairie.</p>\n<p>His work continued, arranging comatose bodies and confiscating wands and knives as he found them. The two in the crater he dragged up to the others. Joe Blakely, the bootmaker. He\u2019d <em>liked </em>Joe, who was a steady, easygoing man who listened well and gave good advice when a fellow had a problem and needed to unburden himself. The Marshal felt an even stronger pang in his heart upon unveiling the fifth; Marie Upwell was the most sought-after young lady in the whole region, and not just because of her cheerful, compassionate nature. Now that he knew it was she, it was hard not to notice the way even that baggy gray robe draped becomingly over her figure. The Marshal hadn\u2019t actively tried to court her\u2014he was one of the few\u2014but embarrassing fantasies involving Marie had kept him company during more than a few quiet nights. He tied them to the others.</p>\n<p>He tried to tune out the baerzurg\u2019s noises, which had become piteous whimpers. He really didn\u2019t want to look up and see what the elf was doing to it.</p>\n<p>There was no need to restrain the two felled by his own wands. Some Imperial Marshals carried customized wands that could deliver varying degrees or kinds of power; some were even amateur enchanters who crafted their own to personal specifications. His were standard Imperial issue, and cast standard-issue lightning bolts which were functionally identical to those that came from the sky. A person <em>could </em>survive a direct hit from a bolt of lightning, but it was a noteworthy event when it happened. It hadn\u2019t happened today.</p>\n<p>So he laid out Jeff Langley, the shy kid newly apprenticed at the bakery, and Walter Jordan, an aging ex-soldier whose ranch lay just over the horizon, with the hoods of their cultist robes over their faces.</p>\n<p>Just as he began to reach for the hood over the figure still frozen upright at the lip of the crater, a great <em>thump</em> shook the ground. He spun to behold the Professor walking toward him and the smoking body of the baerzurg lying in the grass behind her.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch him till I release the spell. He\u2019s stuck in a pocket of slow time; even small impacts could damage him quite a bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the story with that thing?\u201d He jerked his head at the fallen demon.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s thoroughly dead. Burned to a proverbial crisp.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you said it was invincible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly the skin. Anything will die if you systematically incinerate its internal organs.\u201d She grimaced, wiping her hands on her trousers. \u201cNot a very kind way to die, but that\u2019s the price you pay for superficial invulnerability. All right, keep a wand out; I don\u2019t expect much trouble with this guy, but they\u2019ve already surprised us once today.\u201d</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t see her so much as wiggle her fingers at the last cultist, but the man suddenly twitched as though waking from a heavy sleep. \u201cTake her down! They\u2019ll\u2014eh?\u201d</p>\n<p>That was as far as the confused man got before the elf pointed at him and he went tumbling over backward, unconscious.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Careful!\u2019</em>\u201d the Marshal protested. \u201cThere is such a thing as excessive force!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, un-bunch your bloomers, he\u2019s fine. Let\u2019s get him tied up to the rest of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>She did so, while he removed the man\u2019s hood and the scarf wrapped over the lower part of his face. It was definitely not the right weather for that, and the man was even sweatier than the rest of his companions. The Marshal let out a defeated sigh at beholding the refined features of Jackson Towerwell, the clerk at the town hall.</p>\n<p>\u201cOoh, I know him,\u201d the elf said in tones of interest. \u201cJust the chap to have around if you\u2019re planning a spot of skullduggery, eh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, then!\u201d She rubbed her hands together. \u201cSure of those knots, are you? Good, let\u2019s see what our wayward neighbors have to say for themselves.\u201d Leaning forward, she lightly touched Towerwell on the forehead. He started violently and tried to sit upright, succeeding only in entangling himself with Marie. The elf quickly ran down the line, awakening each cultist with a touch.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfternoon, Jackson,\u201d the Marshal said gravely.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Marshal,\u201d the clerk replied in the same tone. He managed to look dignified, even sitting in the dirt with his hands bound behind himself and being tugged about by the tension on the rope as each of his co-conspirators awakened and struggled experimentally. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll confess this is a mite embarrassing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to shoot us, are you, Marshal?\u201d asked Marie tremulously, glancing at the two fallen cultists and then back up at him.</p>\n<p>He pushed back his hat to scratch his head. \u201cNot if I can at all help it, Miss Upwell, which will be contingent upon whether you choose to make it necessary. Needless to say it\u2019s jail for the lot of you till I can send a scroll to the capital. This is Imperial business now.\u201d</p>\n<p>She burst into tears. The Marshal grimaced, not enjoying the irony; even if she was a fairly caught demon cultist, being responsible for a pretty girl weeping never failed to twist his guts into a knot.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, there is one bit of good news,\u201d Towerwell said with weary joviality. \u201cI meant what I said, Marshal; really didn\u2019t like the thought of having to kill you. It sat poorly with all of us, in fact. Disappointing as all this is, I feel a good bit better that we missed that particular chance.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Professor snorted disdainfully, and Towerwell fixed a glare upon her.</p>\n<p>\u201cI see your companion doubts my sincerity. You think all members of the Wreath are necessarily wicked creatures who love nothing but destruction? You\u2019re a fool, girl. We\u2019re the last hope for humanity, the few willing to stand against the tyranny of the gods themselves. Would <em>you </em>dare to tread a mile in our shoes? A great doom is coming, and when it arrives, you\u2019ll wish you\u2019d joined us.\u201d</p>\n<p>She nudged him in the chest with her boot. \u201cDon\u2019t lecture me, you presumptuous tadpole. I\u2019ve <em>met </em>your dark goddess, and frankly she would find you embarrassing. Now, I\u2019ll need you to provide some answers concerning those girls your glorious cause casually murdered. So, we\u2019re going to play a game called \u2018First Person to Talk Doesn\u2019t Get Burned Alive Like June Witwill.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, hold it,\u201d the Marshal snapped, drowning out a few muted exclamations of fear. \u201cThese folks are Imperial prisoners, <em>Professor.</em> If you had the authority to interrogate them, you\u2019ve have shown me the proof of it before now. Nobody\u2019s laying a hand on them till I get backup out here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBoy,\u201d she said very calmly, \u201cafter all we\u2019ve been through together, surely you don\u2019t imagine you can stop me from doing whatever I damn well please?\u201d</p>\n<p>He locked his gaze with hers, refusing to back down an inch. The fact was, she was right; he\u2019d seen this woman in action and knew he wasn\u2019t a match for her. But some things were more important than practicality. He had an oath, and a duty, and an agent of the Tiraan Empire did not throw that aside for anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d asked Towerwell quietly, peering up at the elf.</p>\n<p>She tore her eyes away from the Marshal\u2019s, turning to study the prisoners dispassionately, then smiled. \u201cWell, since we\u2019re all going to be such good friends, I suppose there\u2019s no harm in you knowing at this point.\u201d</p>\n<p>So she told them her name.</p>\n<p>The Marshal took a reflexive step backward, and a new round of struggles and shouts resonated along the row of bound cultists. Jackson Towerwell bared his teeth at the elf in a feral snarl, furiously twitching and shifting his arms, still bound behind himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cAn interesting thesis,\u201d the elf said dryly, \u201cbut I\u2019m afraid those bonds aren\u2019t likely to be any looser just because you suddenly want even more to be out of them. No, don\u2019t stop on my account. By all means, wear yourself out. I have all the time in the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d said the Marshal suddenly, shouldering her aside. \u201cSomething\u2019s not\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Even as he knelt to look more closely at Towerwell, the man convulsed violently, his eyes rolling up, and tumbled over backward, taking Marie down with him. He thrashed in his bonds, beginning to foam the mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, <em>shit,\u201d</em> hissed the Professor. \u201cTheir hands, Marshal. Grab their hands! Stop them!\u201d</p>\n<p>They were too late. All up and down the row, the imprisoned cultists had begun to writhe, a few groaning in obvious agony. Each of them appeared to be suffering some kind of seizure.</p>\n<p>The elf produced a gleaming saber from midair and unceremoniously slashed Towerwell loose from the others. She rolled him, still twitching, over onto his front, revealing a small, brass-bound glass tube tucked into his left hand. Upon close inspection, the Marshal saw that one end bore a needle, which was pressed into his opposite wrist.</p>\n<p>She snatched it out of his grasp, but the damage was done. Already, Towerwell had fallen still, and the others were faltering in their struggles. The Marshal dashed around behind them, seeing the same little needle-tubes pressed into each\u2019s veins.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d he shouted. \u201cWhat can we do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Her voice was like ice. She straightened slowly, glaring down at the glass tube clutched in her hand. \u201cThere are half a dozen poisons this might have been, and I don\u2019t have antidotes for any of them. If I did, it wouldn\u2019t help; they\u2019ve been injected directly into the blood. It wouldn\u2019t be fast enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>He cursed helplessly, clutching Marie Upwell by her shoulders as she twitched weakly, foam dribbling from her perfect lips, then finally went still. He held her, numb, for a few long moments, before lowering her gently to the ground alongside the others. Not one of them still breathed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is that,\u201d he asked, surprised by the calm of his own voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s called a hypodermic syringe. One of the new dwarven inventions. Made for delivering medicine; it\u2019s held in the tube here, then you press the needle into someone\u2019s skin and push the plunger, which sends the fluid right into their bloodstream. I bet it took all of two minutes for someone to figure out how good they\u2019d be for delivering poison. They must\u2019ve had them up their sleeves, above where you\u2019d check to tie the wrists. Rather ingenious, really.\u201d</p>\n<p>He dropped his gaze to Marie\u2019s face. It was an awful sight, her cheeks flecked with foam, eyes rolled up into her skull, mouth twisted in agony. Carefully, he pulled the hood of her robe out from under her head and draped it over her face, then began moving down the line, doing the same for each of them. He didn\u2019t look up from his task as he spoke.</p>\n<p>\u201cWas it true, what you said? You\u2019re really her? Arachne Tellwyrn?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re really <em>she,\u201d</em> she corrected, \u201cand yeah, I am. For all the good it did here.\u201d She threw the syringe to the ground in disgust. \u201cCongratulations, Marshal, you\u2019re now a member of a very elite group of men who\u2019ve seen the great Professor Tellwyrn made a fool of. Fewer than a dozen have joined in the last century. In fact, I think you may be the only one currently alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>She knelt and, with surprising gentleness, closed Jackson Towerwell\u2019s eyes, draping his hood over his face, just as the Marshal reached the other end of the line.</p>\n<p>Finding himself without something immediately to do, he simply sat down in the grass, staring up at her. She sighed heavily, knuckling the small of her back, and turned her head toward the distant town.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just\u2026I don\u2019t believe it. Demon worshipers, in my town.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not so shocking,\u201d she said dismissively. \u201cThe Black Wreath is everywhere. Mostly just folks looking to spice up their lives with a bit of the illicit occult, and a couple of true believers to keep them motivated. No, what\u2019s disturbing is that <em>this </em>circle had a suicide summoner on hand, as well as having been supplied with shiny new tech from the dwarven kingdoms, and every one of them had the will to end it rather than risk being made to talk. Usually, you can count on a few cowards not to realize which is the easier way out. This is <em>not </em>what I expected from a few cultists in some backwater town. I was obviously very close\u2026\u201d She sighed again, then shook herself. \u201cWell. I\u2019m staying at the Willowbranch Inn.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said numbly. \u201cYes. Right. I\u2019ll need to get a statement from you, after I\u2026do something with\u2026\u201d He trailed off, sweeping his gaze across the row of dead cultists who minutes before had been friends and neighbors he was sworn to protect.</p>\n<p>\u201cStatements, sure. Look, I\u2019ve just been embarrassingly thwarted and seen months of investigation go up in smoke. I now have to start over from scratch, as if I have the bloody time for it, which means <em>hoping</em> another lead into another grisly death will surface. I owe it to my faculty not to come home this frustrated; they\u2019ve enough stress on their shoulders with the semester starting in two weeks. As such, I intend to get thoroughly drunk and laid before catching my coach in the morning. Find my room before ten o\u2019clock tonight if you wish to be part of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>With that, she walked away, leaving the poleaxed Imperial Marshal sitting amid the carnage left in her wake.</p>\n<p>Professor Tellwyrn didn\u2019t hurry, but let her feet carry her at their own pace back toward the town. Walking was good for thinking; the legs pumped blood cleanly through the brain.</p>\n<p>How many other cases like this were there, scattered throughout the Empire? Realistically, it was probably a random number. Maybe no more than the four she\u2019d already found. Arachne had been roaming the world for better than three millennia and become very accustomed to the unexplained and just plain weird. Sometimes these events were hints of broader things in motion, but more often they were just the chaotic detritus of a world too full of magic and people like herself who felt the need to stir the pot. But in that time, she\u2019d also learned to trust her hunches; her subconscious mind was a finely tuned machine that drew connections long before she was able to spot them, and right now it was telling her that the case of the exploding girls was not another coincidence.</p>\n<p>The Queen of Demons had seven daughters. Tellwyrn knew, even though she couldn\u2019t yet prove it, that she now had at least three fewer.</p>\n<p>Now, the best thing she could hope for was that somewhere in the Empire, three other innocent young lives had been pointlessly, excruciatingly snuffed out in a blaze of hellfire. The alternative was at least one more archdemon with a brand new human body, running around doing Omnu knew what and not carefully under her own eyes as was the girl who\u2019d survived the possession.</p>\n<p>And if that was the case, \u201ca great doom\u201d didn\u2019t begin to describe it.</p>\n            </div>",

He wouldn\u2019t admit it, but he probably deserved this. He had spent the last half-mile walk ignoring a rock in his boot, periodically shaking his foot on the back-swing so the rock stayed at the front of his steel-toe boot. Quinn longed to get home and the thought of stopping in this 100-degree heat to get rid of another rock was preventing him from thinking with any sort of foresight.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Wake up, eat, work, eat, work, eat, waste time on the internet, sleep \u2013 Quinn\u2019s rote routine had put him on autopilot on his commute back home. He was truly living up to his last name of Gray and wondered if destiny wasn\u2019t actually a bunch of nonsense. The pitiful fact was that stepping on the rock was the most momentous occasion in the past month. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Summers in Ashford were always a slog for anyone who wasn\u2019t in a tank top and shorts. The humidity made clothes feel like cling wrap and cheap deodorant more useless than the sizzling metal benches that lined the walking path. Balancing on his right foot, Quinn searched for any sort of respite from the heat and, luckily for him, about 20 feet off the path was a big white oak tree with shade that called his name. With a target acquired, Quinn hopped with relative grace over to the shaded grass, thanking the years of practice he had had jumping off his right foot to dunk a basketball. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As soon as Quinn reached the shade, he rolled down to his right knee and ultimately rolled on his back. He closed his eyes and hissed out a breath that was laced with frustration. Before he finished his exhale, a familiar shape pinned his right arm to the cool grass and also gave out a long exhale. However, this exhale was trumpeted out and was only laced with relief. At that moment, Quinn couldn\u2019t help but forget his frustrations and a portion of the pain that he felt in his foot. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Opening his eyes and looking to his right, Quinn saw a light blue body only about one foot tall on top of his forearm. With all four legs spread out as if he had just belly-flopped from the top of the tree onto Quinn\u2019s arm below, Phanpy pulled down his off-white hard hat over his eyes with his trunk and let it flop to the ground. Quinn wondered at times if Phanpy would like to have a Pokeball that he could relax in on long hot treks like this. As Quinn thought, Phanpy\u2019s breathing got heavier and heavier until a soft snoring methodically started. It sounded as if it was coming from a miniature trumpet, and it was the tell-tale sign of a sleeping Phanpy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Phanpy wasn\u2019t spectacular by any conventional Pokemon metric, but one thing that he had over all Pokemon, except maybe a Snorlax, was his ability to fall asleep in an instant. For a while, Quinn thought Phanpy had learned the move [Rest] somehow. But after a solid hour of trying to get Phanpy to fall asleep on command in his apartment, Phanpy just stared at Quinn like he was crazy. Ten minutes after Quinn gave up on his endeavor, he found Phanpy on his back in the sunlight of his apartment window with a chorus of the familiar small snores. Phanpy slept when he wanted and only when he wanted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Letting his head fall back to the grass, Quinn tried to distract himself from the pain still shooting up his leg. He looked up into the underbelly of the 50-foot oak tree above him, letting his eyes wander across the branches above. Quinn spotted two Skwovets chasing each other across the branches that were too shaded for leaves to grow. He waited for one of them to slip or fall as they dodged and weaved 30 feet up in the air, but they never did. He then looked a little bit lower and saw a Weedle on an outstretched branch that was halfway done building his cocoon for his eventual evolution. Then Quinn looked directly above him to the top of the tree and saw three bird Pokemon chirping their little hearts out for all the neighborhood to hear. Unfortunately for him, the dancing sunlight and shade made it too hard for him to tell which Pokemon they were as the tree swayed in the breeze. At that moment, a pain hit his gut that was sharper than the rock in his foot as he remembered laying down under a tree like this one. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<hr>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cLook, Mom, a Heracross!\u201d Quinn pointed up to the top of the tree that he and his mom were laying under. The tree was so big that no human could hope to wrap their arms around its trunk.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI don\u2019t see anything. Are you just pulling my leg again?\u201d Lucy said with a smirk on her face as she shielded her eyes from the rays of sunlight that pierced the shade. She sported wavy long chestnut hair which framed a symmetrical face with high cheekbones. Her eyes caught the attention of those around her with a striking blue-green color. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Quinn rolled his eyes as he stood up. \u201cI only said I saw a Celebi because you said you saw an Articuno. At least I picked a legendary Pokemon that might be in a forest. I'm serious about the Heracross! Look!\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lucy failed to keep down a chuckle as she half-heartedly tried to quiet Quinn. \u201cShhh. If it is really there, you\u2019re going to scare it away.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Quinn almost growled out the words, \u201cJust use your old lady binoculars and look at the very top. It\u2019s on the trunk.\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lucy sat up and took out binoculars from her backpack. \u201cOh no, my feeble hands aren\u2019t working like they should. They\u2019re just skin and bone on this decrepit old lady,\u201d Lucy dropped the binoculars, and they landed next to Quinn\u2019s foot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cMom, you\u2019re not that old. Just look; I bet you've never seen one before.\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cNever seen a Heracross? Please,\u201d she said, dragging the \u201cplease\u201d into two syllables. \u201cI live in trees like these. My downstairs neighbors are Herracrosses.\u201d Lucy puffed out her chest with a gleam in her eye as she picked up the binoculars to look. \u201cYou said near the top, on the trunk?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cYeah. It\u2019s hard to see, but it\u2019s there!\u201d Quinn spoke so fast he started to mumble his words together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cOh my goodness, Quinn. I see it! It\u2019s camouflaged really well. How on earth did you see it?\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At this confirmation, Quinn tried to hide his excitement, but he couldn\u2019t help but bounce on the balls of his feet. \u201cI knew it! Most people don\u2019t like Bug-type Pokemon and they say they\u2019re gross, but that\u2019s just because they only see Wrumples and Blipbugs everywhere. Show anyone a Heracross and they'll change their mind.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lucy looked at her son and started to laugh out loud. \u201cWatch out there, Quinn. That\u2019s more emotion than you have shown in a month.\u201d At that moment, with all the noise the two were making, the Heracross dislodged from the tree and flew off into the canopy of the forest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWow, Mom. I can\u2019t believe you get to climb giant trees like this and see all kinds of cool Pokemon up close,\u201d Quinn said, still trying to follow the flight path of the giant beetle.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lucy scrunched her face up. \u201cI don\u2019t just go climb trees and look for Pokemon. It\u2019s hard work to do what I do.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI know, I know. We can\u2019t let dead trees and branches fall whenever they like. Someone has to be the Reaper of Trees.\u201d Quinn chuckled as he remembered the name that his Mom\u2019s boss gave her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lucy got up on her feet and inched closer to Quinn. \u201cYes, I'm the Reaper of Trees, and I have come to exact the revenge of all the twigs you have stepped on!\u201d Lucy grabbed Quinn and started to tickle him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Quinn couldn\u2019t help but laugh as he tried to get away, but his mom had him in too tight of a hold. Eventually, the Reaper ended her assault and Quinn caught his breath. \u201cUgh, why am I so ticklish and you aren\u2019t? That should be genetic or something.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Quinn didn\u2019t catch it, but Lucy\u2019s shoulders dropped a little at that. The two didn\u2019t say anything for about a minute when Lucy broke the silence. \u201cYou know that you\u2019re turning 13 here soon, right?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cDuh, I'm so ready to be a teenager. I'm sick of everyone treating me like a kid.\u201d Quinn grumbled as he thought about how kids in the eighth grade treated him before summer break.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lucy dawned a poker face. \u201cWell, I agree. You\u2019re getting older and are ready to be a teenager. And when we get older we get more responsibility,\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Quinn tried to decipher what she meant by \u201cmore responsibility,\u201d but couldn\u2019t see the trap she'd set up. \u201cSure\u2026\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lucy, enjoying the tension she was building, let the conversation lull for a couple more seconds. Breaking the silence, Lucy said, \u201cAnd what takes more responsibility than taking care of someone else?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cUmmm\u2026\u201d Quinn paused as he tried to understand what his mom was getting at. Then it hit him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">His mouth opened up so wide that he might have let some of those Bug-type Pokemon he adored fly into his mouth. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And with a smile that showed off all 32 of her pearly whites, Lucy said, \u201cYep.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Quinn hugged Lucy and said, \u201cThank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you\u2026\u201d followed by at least 30 more thank-yous before he ran out of breath. After taking another big breath, Quinn asked while looking behind his mom, \u201cDo you have them with you?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cNo, no. We both need to meet the Pokemon before we have them join the Gray family. Not every Pokemon will be able to live up to our legacy,\u201d Lucy said with her most regal face. She continued, \u201cHowever, I did hear that Mr. Tucker\u2019s Donphan had a bunch of eggs hatch three days ago. He said there's one that\u2019s too small for farm work. Do you think he'll be too small for our apartment?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cA Phanpy?! That would be the coolest Pokemon ever! Phanpys are so strong that they can pick up their trainers! Can we go see the Phanpy now?!\u201d Quinn exclaimed as he bounced around like he was about to wet himself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lucy stopped herself from another fit of laughter and said, \u201cYes, we can go now. Mr. Tucker already knows we\u2019re coming. But before you get any big ideas, no battling.\u201d Lucy said while she failed to keep a smile off her face. \u201cWe barely have room for a Phanpy \u2014 there is no way we can house a 250-pound Donphan!\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWhatever you say goes,\u201d Quinn reassured his mom. All he cared about was having a Pokemon that he could call a friend.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<hr>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Quinn lost track of time under the tree remembering that day with his mom, but pinpricks in his right hand got him out of his half-dazed state. His Phanpy was small in comparison to pretty much any other grown Phanpy, but a small Phanpy still weighed 50 pounds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cPhanpy, you gave me a dead arm again. This is why you don\u2019t sleep in my bed,\u201d Quinn told a still-sleeping Phanpy, even though there were a myriad of other reasons why Quinn\u2019s bed had a one-person occupancy. \u201cCome on, roll off my arm. I need to check if this is a rock in my shoe or a Larvitar.\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Eventually, he wormed his hand out, and Phanpy stirred awake, ending the persistent small trumpeting coming from his trunk. Quinn sat up and started opening and closing his hand in an attempt to maximize blood flow while pulling up his left pant leg to gain access to the laces at the top of his boot. These boots had been good to Quinn over the years, but he might need to get a new pair if he didn\u2019t want to pick up rock collecting as a hobby. Quickly untying the boot with his left hand, Quinn looked at the ball of his foot with the sock still on and found the offender lodged in the middle.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cUgh, why did it have to draw blood?\u201d Quinn asked no one in particular as he pulled the rock out of his foot and the sock off to assess the damage. At the sound of the word \u201cblood,\u201d Phanpy sat up so fast that his hard hat fell off his head and landed to the side with the Pokeball logo facing Quinn. Trying to figure out what went wrong, Phanpy looked at Quinn's exposed left foot and saw the injury. He trumpeted in alarm and looked up at Quinn. Phanpy must have noticed Quinn\u2019s puffy eyes because Phanpy\u2019s ears dropped and a look of sympathy replaced the look of alarm. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cYes, you should feel bad for me. They may have to amputate,\u201d Quinn teased with a smile. Quinn knew that his puffy eyes and evidence of tears on his face weren\u2019t caused by the rock, but he didn\u2019t want to try and explain that to Phanpy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cPhanpy, can you get the bandages out of my purse? I think they're in the small inside pocket.\u201d Phanpy nodded his head and ran around Quinn to open the purse that still hung around his left shoulder. Quinn knew most people did a double take when they heard him call his purse a purse, but he didn\u2019t care. Guys always try to call their purses other names to make them sound manly: satchel, briefcase, shoulder bag. Quinn once heard a guy refer to his purse as a bro-sack, which made for an uncomfortable situation after Quinn laughed, thinking the guy was joking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Most people would be surprised to see how nimble a Phanpy could be with its trunk. Quinn not only asked Phanpy for help because he didn\u2019t want his foot to touch the ground but also because Phanpy would be able to get the bandages before Quinn could, even if he used both hands. After a few seconds, Phanpy gave a short snort and held the bandages high up in the air as if he were showing off a gold nugget.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThank you, Phanpy. You sure are quick when you want to be.\u201d Quinn took the bandages and scratched the back of Phanpy\u2019s right ear. At that, Phanpy gave out an almost purr-like sound of happiness.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Quinn examined his foot closer and saw that while the rock had punctured the skin, the wound was no longer bleeding. He was no medic, but he didn\u2019t think it would need stitches. Not that he'd go to a center to get it stitched up, but he felt a little better that he wouldn\u2019t have to find a how-to video online about sewing yourself back up. Quinn would just need to keep the wound clean, bandaged, and ignore any pain it caused.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Quinn bandaged his foot and put Phanpy\u2019s hard hat back on his head. Phanpy adjusted that hat to his liking and started to sniff around for dandelions. They were a strange treat for him, but seeing how they're weeds, Quinn never stopped Phanpy from being the Reaper of Dandelions, which his mom used to always call him. Quinn looked around, more aware of his surroundings now that his foot pain was dulled, as he put his sock and shoe back on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This walking path went right through the middle of Ashford and was quite lively today despite the heat. Quinn could see around 20 people on the path, with most people walking and a handful of people on bikes. One intense-looking man was running at a pace that would be a sprint for Quinn, a teenage boy was walking seven different types of Pokemon and actively working to keep the leashes from tangling, and two moms chatted under a neighboring tree as their kids played tag close by. However, everyone was avoiding the hot metal benches like the plague. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">About 30 yards down the path, he saw two people talking next to a Growlithe that was sniffing a lamppost and a Rockruff sniffing the Growlithe. After a few seconds of sniffing, the Growlithe lifted his leg and let it fly. Unfortunately for the Rockruff, there was some friendly fire involved which sent the Rockruff yelping back to its presumed owner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Distracted by the dog debacle, Quinn didn\u2019t notice two teenage girls stop on the path, one of them shrieking, \u201cSofia! Look how cute that Phanpy is! It has a hard hat and everything!\u201d Without missing a beat, the other girl squealed along with her friend as they grabbed each other's hands and ran up to Phanpy. Phanpy, seeing an opportunity to get some scratches, put on the charm by lifting his ears so his hat lifted off the crown of his head and trumpeted out a perfect high C. Quinn could swear he could see both girls starting to tear up at how cute Phanpy was being. Phanpy knew he had them hooked, and so he flopped on his side with his belly exposed to the girls, inviting them to give him compensation for his spectacular performance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sofia still had some sense to look around for Phanpy\u2019s owner for permission before pouncing. After seeing Quinn sitting in the shade not too far away, she said, \u201cJenny, wait. Hello, is this your Phanpy?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Quinn\u2019s evil side showed itself as he briefly thought it would be funny to tell the two girls that Phanpy had rabies and they needed to stay away. However, as soon as Sofia and Jenny looked away from Phanpy, Phanpy gave a glare to Quinn that could paralyze any human or Pokemon. Putting all those thoughts away, with a smile, Quinn said, \u201cYep, and he loves scratches behind his ears.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With nothing holding the two girls back, they showered Phanpy in compliments and scratches for the next few minutes. Phanpy soaked it all in and knew precisely when to give gleeful trumpets whenever Jenny or Sofia hit the perfect spots. Their energy took a while to die down, but eventually, Jenny asked Quinn, \u201cWhy does he wear a hard hat?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cPhanpy works with me building the new offices on the west side of Ashford next to the old Poke Mart. All workers, Pokemon included, are required to wear a hard hat, and he just loves it. It's been four years since we started working construction, and he never leaves the house without it. I have no idea why he wears it when he doesn\u2019t have to, they make my head itch.\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sofia joined in the conversation, \u201cReally? That\u2019s so cool that you work with Phanpy. My dad works with his Pokemon too! He has two Slowpokes that help him fish out at Mirror Lake. He says that they catch more than him most days!\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While Sofia was talking about her dad and the kinds of fish he'd catch, she talked with her hands to convey the sizes of some of the fish. Phanpy, noticing that Sofia\u2019s hands were needlessly not scratching his belly, gave out a melody of three short trumpets that got her attention back on him. Quinn smiled and couldn\u2019t help but wish he had a quarter of Phanpy\u2019s natural charisma.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Quinn wasn\u2019t surprised to hear about Sofia\u2019s dad and his Slowpokes. Working with your Pokemon was pretty common, especially in manual labor positions. Pokemon are capable of doing jobs so much easier by using their natural strength, speed, flight, or moves to do things that would take humans much longer. When work was slow last winter, the only reason that Quinn wasn\u2019t laid off was because Phanpy made life so much easier for the rest of the crew. Pretty much any Ground-type Pokemon can manipulate dirt and soil, but Phanpy had a certain finesse that other Pokemon lack. Quinn\u2019s boss always praised Phanpy for being able to locate rocks in the ground where a foundation needed to be laid and bringing them to the surface for some of the other stronger Pokemon to move easily. And if that wasn\u2019t enough to be everyone\u2019s favorite elephant, Phanpy could easily smooth and level any patch of dirt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Remembering that scary time when Quinn thought he might lose his job and all the other crap that Phanpy had lived through with him, he didn\u2019t want to think about where he'd be if his mom hadn\u2019t struck up a conversation with Mr. Tucker over nine years ago.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Quinn, shaking himself out of his deep thoughts, told Phanpy, \u201cHey, do that thing!\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Without missing a beat, Phanpy shot up to his feet, grabbed his hard hat with his trunk, and backed away from the two girls but closer to Quinn. With the girls' full and undivided attention, Phanpy threw the hard hat five feet up in the air. As the hat flipped end over end, Phanpy waited for the perfect moment when the top of the hard hat was facing down and shot a stream of water out of his trunk, hitting the hard hat dead center. Keeping the stream at a constant pressure, Phanpy worked to balance the hat on the top of his [Water Gun].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sofia and Jenny erupted in a cheer that would rival any crowd 10 times their size. \u201cPhanpy! You\u2019re amazing!\u201d The girls continued to cheer and clap as Phanpy started spinning around while keeping the hat balanced. Phanpy couldn\u2019t keep a [Water Gun] going for more than about 15 seconds, but he milked the spotlight for as long as he could. When Phanpy knew he was running out of water, he gave one last burst of all the remaining liquid, and the hat sailed up until it hit a bottom branch of the tree. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Quinn, not following where the hard hat fell, looked at Phanpy, who was posing like they'd practiced with his front two legs up in the air and his trunk arched up and over his head. Quinn joined Sofia and Jenny in clapping and gave a mocking cat call, \u201cOw ow!\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, Quinn\u2019s applause was interrupted as he felt a splash on the top of his head. \u201cPhanpy, you need to work on your aim! I may be sweating up a storm, but that doesn\u2019t mean I want a shower.\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The girls looked on the top of Quinn\u2019s head to see the damage. Sofia immediately burst out laughing while Jenny tried not to laugh but just ended up snorting out her response, \u201cI bet you'll want a shower from Phanpy when you see what really landed on your head.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Quinn looked up to see the backside of a Pidove on the branch above and wished for a world where Phanpy had worse aim.</span></p>\n            </div>",

        "chapter_content": "<div class=\"chapter-inner chapter-content\">\n                <p>Drop Night\u2014when the new card set was released by the gods\u2014was the single biggest holiday for everyone around the world. The one time every decade that people might receive a god-gifted deck and instantly become a deckbearer.</p>\n<p>Everyone desperately hoped that they would be chosen, and everyone did something to prepare for or celebrate the night. Perhaps sit in the dark, hands clasped, hoping fate would change their lives. Perhaps performing last-minute deeds that they thought would convince one faction of the gods to reward them with a deck.</p>\n<p>But most people threw a party. Alcohol and drugs worked equally well for celebrating good luck and drowning sorrows, after all.</p>\n<p>Wolfe slowly walked through the massive rave he had been required to attend, across a fog-laced dance floor filled with red strobe lights and statues of demons and giant flies, his bones reverberating from the loud club music. He did his best to weave his way among the drunk and high partiers as he made his way to the VIP section.</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t help but think that while the gods had never talked to anyone, it was still painfully obvious they had favorites. This whole party was a celebration for one family, Wolfe\u2019s employer, the Grimms. Clearly favored of Beelzebub, a dark god of the Infernal faction and Master of Gluttony. There were five crime organizations in Noimore, although two groups\u2014the ultra-violent Cobras and the weirdos who called themselves the \u2018Weeds\u2019\u2014weren\u2019t run by an actual family. Each was favored by a different Lord of the Infernal, it seemed.</p>\n<p>Wolfe scratched at his chest he walked. The scar tissue from an encounter with a deckbearer itched, and Wolfe didn\u2019t feel like getting drunk or high enough to ignore it.</p>\n<p>A tiny girl in a black miniskirt and bra, young and moderately pretty with medium-length blonde hair shaved on one side, bumped into Wolfe and bounced off six-foot-two, two hundred and thirty pounds of nothing but rock-solid muscle frame. Her drink spilled onto Wolfe\u2019s gray Armani suit\u2014gift from Big Man Grimm himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you shill\u2014spill\u2014my drink?\u201d the girl slurred at him, slapping his arm. \u201cI\u2019m gonna ge\u2019 a deck tonight!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wolfe stared at her for a moment, then glanced up at the man who was dancing with her: Richard \u2018Rich\u2019 Cordova, one of the other enforcers who worked for Big Man Grimm, same as Wolfe. He met the other man\u2019s brown eyes with his own hazel gaze, a stare he knew others found disconcerting. Especially those who knew Wolfe\u2019s reputation.</p>\n<p>Rich went white and grabbed the girl, pulling her away. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Wolfe. Um, Tiffany just had an accident. I\u2019ll pay for the\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother. Just get her out of here,\u201d Wolfe growled out.</p>\n<p>Tiffany pouted. \u201cBut I still want to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Rich put his hand over her mouth and hissed, \u201cShut up!\u201d and then glanced at Wolfe. \u201cWe were just heading out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wolfe turned away, irritated at himself for being irritable. But he was\u2014and he knew why. He had hoped so hard to get a deck three times already, only to be disappointed. The gods didn\u2019t care about people like Wolfe. He had been to these parties twice, once when he\u2019d been eighteen and newly in the family, and once when he\u2019d been twenty-eight and full of adrenaline.</p>\n<p>But this Drop Night, he didn\u2019t want to be at the club\u2014he wanted to be at home, even though it was empty now that his only real friend\u2014his dog, Pierce\u2014had died.</p>\n<p>But Big Man Grimm wanted all the important members of the family\u2019s business here, and that included his number one enforcer. He was probably hoping for a god-gifted deck for one of his kids, or perhaps one of his cousins. You <em>could</em> put the ten cards necessary to make a deck together by buying them\u2014like Big Man Grimm had for his three kids already\u2014or possibly even by acquiring them from another deckbearer or the weird monsters or dungeons that were also generated on Drop Night. But a lot of the god-gifted decks would have a single special card, new to the drop, and were usually themed well for early play.</p>\n<p>Plus, the cards were <em>expensive</em>.<em> </em>The absolute weakest ones tended to go for around fifty thousand, since you could always combine cards to make higher-tier versions.</p>\n<p>Wolfe made his way past other drunk-ass girls and men who thought they were dangerous to reach the clubs most important table, the one with the people who mattered: Big Man Grimm, his inner circle, and his family. As Wolfe did, he passed another girl but this one caught his attention\u2014she was barely five feet tall, with strawberry-blond hair, green eyes, and freckles, all set in an innocent and very young-looking face. She had a white t-shirt that covered everything but her face and arms and a pair of modest jeans. She wasn\u2019t sloshed, high, or dressed at all provocatively, and stood out like a nun in a boxing ring.</p>\n<p><em>What\u2019s a girl like that doing in a place like this? She clearly doesn\u2019t belong.</em></p>\n<p>Wolfe put it from his mind as he approached the table.</p>\n<p>Two rough appearing, large thugs who looked almost like brothers\u2014Harry and Pete\u2014were guarding the table. Each man was in his late twenties, with brown eyes and black hair, and bodies muscular but subtly awkward to Wolfe\u2019s experienced eye. Harry was a bit broader in the shoulders, and Pete was about an inch, maybe two, taller, but they were hard to tell apart if you hadn\u2019t worked with them for years.</p>\n<p>Neither batted an eye as Wolfe slid into the last place on the outside edge of the VIP table. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late, boss.\u201d</p>\n<p>A young Southeast Asian woman in a slinky black dress walked up from just past Pete and Harry and poured expensive brandy into a glass in front of Wolfe. But as Wolfe glanced at her, he saw she was staring at Big Man Grimm, not him. She smiled extra wide at Wolfe\u2019s boss, then backed away. Big Man Grimm watched her go for a second before turning his attention to Wolfe.</p>\n<p>Big Man Grimm \u2014Thaddeus Grimm, Senior\u2014looked and sounded like his name. He was big\u2026 and grim. Sixty years old, but still two inches taller even than Wolfe, and he had stayed healthy in an old-man way, with a lean body and large muscles that still couldn\u2019t hide his nearly white hair and wrinkled skin. He almost never smiled, and when he did, it wasn\u2019t a good thing. But the scariest thing about him was his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were just talking about my children,\u201d Big Man Grimm said in a voice heavy, deep, dark, and menace-filled. \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll get a god-gifted deck?\u201d</p>\n<p>The boss swept his arm to take in his three children among the eight other people at the table.</p>\n<p>Thaddeus Grimm, Junior was almost as tall as his old man, although he had far less muscle mass. He was just shy of thirty and extremely good-looking. But he was so drunk right now, he could barely sit straight. He was also watching the girls on the dance floor instead of paying attention to what was happening at the table.</p>\n<p>Damian Grimm, the middle child, was considerably younger at twenty-one. He was a hobbit by comparison, only five feet tall, with fat rolls under his chin he tried to hide with a scraggly beard and eyes that didn\u2019t sit right on his face\u2014the left one looked like it was trying to escape around the back of his head. He was watching his father with an expression that bordered on the lust he usually reserved for the girls he paid to abuse.</p>\n<p>Wolfe frowned, reflecting on the fact that Damian was the most likely successor to Big Man Grimm, given his older brothers room-temperature I.Q.</p>\n<p>The last child, Miriam, was a beauty like most of the family. She had inherited height from her father, but had her mother\u2019s green eyes and long, thick, black hair. She was dressed in a slick, black cocktail dress and enough emerald jewelry to pay for a car. Her demeanor was casually superior as she leaned back in the booth, staring at everyone around the table with an expression of amused condescension. Miriam was in her first year of college as a pre-law and criminal justice double major and had never been considered as a successor to Big Man Grimm. Nor had she ever expressed the desire to be part of the family business.</p>\n<p>\u201cMight be someone\u2019s lucky night,\u201d Wolfe said, sipping at the expensive brandy. It left a genteel trail of heat all the way to his belly, smooth as caramel. \u201cAs long as you haven\u2019t yet received a god-gifted deck, the gods might send you one\u2014even if you\u2019ve already put together a deck through other means. Odds aren\u2019t great, though. One in five hundred is nothing to write home about.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wolfe wondered where Big Man Grimm\u2019s wife, Guinevere, was. The shrill but beautiful harpy usually attended these functions.</p>\n<p>Heinrick Grimm, Big Man Grimm\u2019s accountant, piped in, \u201cI\u2019m sure they will, cousin. You\u2019ve given much to advance the causes of Beelzebub, after all, and he has favored the family greatly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wolfe scowled at Heinrich. <em>What a cocksucker. </em>The man, a few years older than Wolfe, stared at him, raised an eyebrow over his intelligent, brown eye, and quirked a smile full of perfect white teeth. <em>Jackass.</em></p>\n<p>Plus, Heinrich\u2019s statement was questionable at best. Beelzebub seemed to favor Big Man Grimm, certainly. The boss had gotten a deck that had a lot of Beelzebub\u2019s named cards in it when he\u2019d been young\u2014and, from what Wolfe had heard, made the deck <em>very </em>powerful and full of rare cards since\u2014but the others all had decks that had been bought for them. No other cards had been divinely gifted to the family since the patriarch had received his.</p>\n<p>No one else said anything for a bit, the conversation stalling. None of the lesser members of the hierarchy at the table\u2014Jed the enforcer, Heinrich\u2019s son Ian, or Peter \u201cPiper\u201d Risoni, the current man in charge of running the distribution of their product, bothered to answer.</p>\n<p>Then Thad Junior piped in. \u201cHey, has anyone seen Johnny, by the way? I thought he\u2019d be here tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Big Man Grimm didn\u2019t answer his son, just frowning at him with a brow so furrowed, it threatened to split his face in two. Damian shook his head in theatrical disgust at his older brother, and most of the others around the table frowned. Johnny, a long-time supporter of Big Man Grimm and one of his best drug couriers, had been wiped out in an ambush last week. The Cobras had brazenly left their calling card and the drugs he had been moving for the Grimm family had all been stolen. No one knew how the Cobras had found out he\u2019d been moving product into town, or where he would be. Millions of dollars in product had gone missing.</p>\n<p>From the claw marks, and the fire and death magic marks, everyone was pretty sure it had been a deckbearer. Most likely Nico, the number one enforcer for the Cobras. The closest thing to a nemesis that Wolfe had.</p>\n<p>Big Man Grimm turned to Wolfe. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to spoil Drop Night, but I\u2019m going to need you to do what you do best again. The Cobras have been cutting us to pieces. It\u2019s time for you to hit back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wolfe\u2019s scowl deepened. <em>I\u2019ve killed two deckbearers, without a deck of my own, in twenty years. Now I have to do it again? Big Man Grimm used the cards from the deckbearers I killed to make his own deck, and his children\u2019s, stronger, but I\u2019m still not a deckbearer. Even though it\u2019s obvious the big man trusts me, just a two-bit thug without a deck, to handle fucking up his enemies more than he trusts his own deckbearer kids to do the same. Plus, every time I\u2019ve gone up against Nico and his deck, I\u2019ve been chased off. I need my own deck to take him out.</em></p>\n<p>His eyes flicked to Big Man Grimm. He owed the man everything. But Wolfe still wished Big Man Grimm had allowed Wolfe to keep the cards he had killed, so to speak.</p>\n<p>Wolfe\u2019s boss must have sensed his mood, because he took a package from the seat next to him and passed it across the table to Wolfe. \u201cHere. I was gonna give this to you after midnight, when the new deckbearers had been picked, but have it now. We don\u2019t need both of us scowling and ready to kill everyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Wolfe asked, picking the package up. It was the size of a shoebox, and weighed a bit. But when Wolfe surreptitiously shook it, nothing seemed to move inside.</p>\n<p>Big Man Grimm shifted in his seat, glowering out at the floor, where the bodies of the dancers were visible as silhouettes through the smoke and lights. \u201cBonus and a promise, for my best and most loyal packmate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Both Thad Junior and Heinrich scowled at that statement.</p>\n<p>Big Man Grimm ignored them. \u201cTake it and open it alone. In fact, use Suite Two on the upper floor. Also, I give you my word\u2014you can have the cards of the next deckbearer you end. I know you\u2019ve balanced the sheets between us.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was Damian\u2019s turn to scowl, and he picked a shot glass off the table and threw it back.</p>\n<p>Wolfe felt himself warming a bit. Big Man Grimm wasn\u2019t a good man. But he was an honorable man who took care of his people nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Wolfe picked up the package from the table and stood. \u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p>\n<p>He got a respectful nod from Big Man Grimm and Damian, but no one else at the table acknowledged him as he left.</p>\n<p>He walked around the outside of the dance floor\u2014hoping to avoid any more \u2018Tiffanys\u2019\u2014and reached the elevator. He took it to the second floor and exited. It was the big man\u2019s private set of suites. Suite Two was his best guest suite in the entire Ekron Eternal, the big man\u2019s club.</p>\n<p>Wolfe entered the suite and shut the door. It was a huge, penthouse-style room. There was a bar, circular couches around a central table with a statuette in the middle, even a goddamn indoor jacuzzi. That was just the front room\u2014it also had a bedroom and bathroom. Most of the suite was done in garish red and black, thick curtains and velvet, with art\u2014a sort of baroque-style depiction of the Infernal in both painting and statuary\u2014liberally spread around. A iron clock with its gears showing hung on one wall, its style out of place.</p>\n<p>Wolfe imagined he could almost smell blood and incense from the overly themed room, although there wasn\u2019t any. He wished the Grimm family didn\u2019t advertise their associations so openly. He knew that even though there was no sure proof that the various gods paid attention to man, most fancied that the beings mentioned in the cards would help them if they worshipped the supposed gods.</p>\n<p><em>The sounds of Drop Night celebration and a few early fireworks outside the window really mute the evil vibe, though</em>, Wolfe thought with a sardonic grin.</p>\n<p>Wolfe put his package down on the marble bar top and then sat on one of the barstools. He grabbed an ashtray, pulled a half-full cigarette pack from his pocket, removed a cigarette, tapped it, then pulled his lighter and lit it up.</p>\n<p>Once he had smoked for a few seconds, he glanced at the clock on the wall.</p>\n<p>11:58 p.m.</p>\n<p>He was tempted to wait for the very moment of Drop Night but then cursed himself for a fool. He tore open the package and stared at it.</p>\n<p>The majority was a thick stack of <em>thousand-dollar </em>bills\u2026 and the top was a stylized card that appeared to be a blank creature card.</p>\n<p>Wolfe was pretty sure it was a promissory note\u2014promising him that he would receive at least some kind of deck and become a deckbearer. Big Man Grimm could do it if he wanted\u2014and he\u2019d been there for Wolfe when\u2014</p>\n<p>A fiery pain in his chest caused him to yank his shirt open. He saw the huge, raised-off-the-skin scar where he had been cut by Nico\u2019s summoned creature almost a decade ago. There was a brief flash of flame, a pentagram, and then chains seemed to briefly appear above his chest. After a second, they sank into his scarred flesh and disappeared.</p>\n<p>His own eyes wide in shock, Wolfe slowly touched his chest with a trembling hand splayed open in the gesture everyone knew from watching hundreds of TV shows about deckbearers. A sense of fire and eternal hunger, as well as a controlled rage and purpose, filled Wolfe, all of it tempered by a feeling of limitless possibility.</p>\n<p>His heart beat so fast, he thought it might burst. Wolfe held his hand out, still splayed open.</p>\n<p>A red, fiery light pushed out from his hands and manifested as three cards, each the size of a normal playing card, hovering in front of Wolfe, just like it would have for every newbie deckbearer ever. A fourth card also manifested, hovering in the air off to the side\u2014which wasn\u2019t normal. A new deckbearer always had ten cards, and pulled three random ones at a time. The fourth card was very unusual.</p>\n<p>Wolfe had two copies of an \u2018escaped damned\u2019 card, as well as the \u2018tormentor imp\u2019 card. All three cost one Infernal power and were tier-one\u2014the weakest cards you could get.</p>\n<p>But still cards!</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Wolfe muttered. A piece of him was concerned he had received an Infernal god-gifted deck, but in that moment, most of him was just overjoyed to have received a deck at all.</p>\n<p>Wolfe\u2019s eyes strayed to the last card, the fourth one. He knew instantly it was different\u2026 it had no power cost, it was labeled as a companion card, and it was unique. Cards had both rarity and tier. Rarity tended to reflect starting strength compared to its power cost, and each tier was just a slightly stronger version of the same card.</p>\n<p>Unique cards could be nearly any effective rarity in quality, and since they couldn\u2019t be raised in tier, were assigned an \u2018effective tier\u2019 to explain their total strength. Tier-seven was\u2026 ridiculously high.</p>\n<div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"145\">\n<p>Cereboo (Unique, effective Power 2, effective Tier-7)</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"234\">\n<p>0 power</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"379\">\n<p>A pup of Cerberus.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"145\">\n<p>Infernal, Beast[Dog]</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"234\">\n<p>Companion</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"145\">\n<p>Attack</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"234\">\n<p>5 x 3</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"145\">\n<p>Magical Attack</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"234\">\n<p>7</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"145\">\n<p>Defense</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"234\">\n<p>7</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"145\">\n<p>Magical Defense</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"234\">\n<p>4</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"145\">\n<p>Health</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"234\">\n<p>12</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"379\">\n<p>Special: Companion.

The picture of the pup reminded Wolfe of his late dog, Pierce, but with three heads and red skin.</p>\n<p>Was this the gods sending him a sign?</p>\n<p>\u201cPierce better not be in some hell,\u201d Wolfe quipped. Then he gave a dark chuckle\u2014he knew damn well his dog hadn\u2019t gone to any bad place in the cosmos. He was the only purely good being Wolfe had ever known, even if he had been a bit of a doofus.</p>\n<p>He thought about the promised reward as well. Legendary cards were so rare that only the most famous card users had more than one or two, and Mythics were almost unheard of. <em>The gods might have power crept this season</em>. Wolfe\u2019s mind raced with the possibilities.</p>\n<p>Wolfe was about to pull up his status sheet when his phone went off. <em>What the fuck? It\u2019s been like four minutes since the drop! How the hells can someone already need me?</em></p>\n<p>He pulled it out to see who was calling, then answered immediately.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, boss?\u201d</p>\n<p>Big Man Grimm\u2019s voice came through the phone. \u201cGet down here.

You do <em>not </em>want to miss this!\u201d the professor shouts as everyone begins to gather their things. He\u2019s an older looking man with long hair and is wearing a business suit that I\u2019m willing to bet is probably enchanted. Although considering his level, who knows what his actual age is. There are some people out there with odd classes that make you look old even if you\u2019re not for some reason. \u201cUnless you <em>want </em>to fall behind in level!\u201d</p>\n<p>Everyone ignores him, simply focusing on moving as fast as they can so that they can have more time to prepare for the dungeon dive. The first field excursion of the year for us first years at the Royal Academy. And something I\u2019ve personally been looking forward to for a while now.</p>\n<p>Because why wouldn\u2019t someone want to go to the Royal Dungeon? It\u2019s the best place to level in the entire kingdom after all. And the King is <em>very</em> much known for hogging his dungeon to his loyal retainers and the Royal Academy students, simply to keep accumulating more power and as an incentive for others to attend his academy.</p>\n<p>Typical Ascendant.</p>\n<p>Which is all the more reason to dream of becoming one myself one of these days. So I can do what I want without a care as well. Not that I really believe that it\u2019s possible.</p>\n<p>I shake my head at that as I stand up, pulling my laptop bag over my shoulder and beginning to make my way towards the aisle of the classroom. But before I can reach it, I hear a familiar voice shout from the entrance, bringing my eyes over to find my twin standing there with her hands on her hips as she patiently taps her feet. \u201cLexi, hurry up! I won\u2019t be missing this!\u201d</p>\n<p>That has me letting out a short sigh before I continue walking towards the aisle while ignoring some of the looks people are sending either me or my sister, some amused, others not so much. Thankfully most of the students in my class are just ignoring us as they go about their own business.</p>\n<p>Once I reach the door of the classroom where she\u2019s standing, I tell her, \u201cWould you mind not shouting at me in a room full of other students?\u201d</p>\n<p>She raises a brow at that, only to shrug and turn around, beginning her trek down the hall without a word.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s a yes then. Good.</p>\n<p>Still wish she would voice it more often though.</p>\n<p>I begin following her as I glance around at the students we pass in the hallway, each wearing their own armor instead of any sort of stuffy uniform. Something I\u2019ve heard the academies from other kingdoms often require of their students.</p>\n<p>A rather stupid thing if you ask me. Another reason why my sister and I chose this academy instead of going to a different kingdom and attending theirs. Well, that and it\u2019s where the old man went.</p>\n<p>Speaking of my sister, I glance at her to find her wearing a set of armor mirroring my own enchanted black leather armor, the both of us taught by the same Magic Knight who adopted the two of us when we were just five years old. And he always talks about how we got our preference in armor from him, which he seems to be rather proud of.</p>\n<p>Most likely. He mentions it at least once a month, so he\u2019s probably proud of that fact.</p>\n<p>As we walk, I open my status.</p>\n<div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; background-color: rgba(3, 0, 0, 1); border-color: rgba(3, 0, 0, 1); border-style: outset; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 84.7475%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 50.7443%\" colspan=\"3\" width=\"270\"><span style=\"color: rgba(253, 0, 0, 1); font-size: 1.3em\"><strong>Name: Alexia Knight</strong></span></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 48.9485%\" colspan=\"3\" width=\"270\"><span style=\"color: rgba(253, 0, 0, 1); font-size: 1.3em\"><strong>Species: Human(T1)</strong></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; background-color: rgba(52, 73, 94, 1); width: 50.7443%\" colspan=\"3\" width=\"270\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.1em\"><strong>Level: 35</strong></span></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; background-color: rgba(52, 73, 94, 1); width: 48.9485%\" colspan=\"3\" width=\"270\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.1em\"><strong>Class: </strong><strong>Magic Knight</strong></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; background-color: rgba(52, 73, 94, 1); width: 50.7443%\" colspan=\"3\" width=\"270\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.1em\"><strong>Health: 700/700</strong></span></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; background-color: rgba(52, 73, 94, 1); width: 48.9485%\" colspan=\"3\" width=\"270\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.1em\"><strong>Mana: 1050/1050</strong></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; background-color: rgba(52, 73, 94, 1); width: 21.0998%\" width=\"108\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.1em\"><strong>VIT: 69</strong></span></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; background-color: rgba(52, 73, 94, 1); width: 18.2941%\" width=\"108\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.1em\"><strong>DEX: 103</strong></span></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; background-color: rgba(52, 73, 94, 1); width: 22.7008%\" colspan=\"2\" width=\"108\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.1em\"><strong>STR: 137</strong></span></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; background-color: rgba(52, 73, 94, 1); width: 17.9573%\" width=\"108\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.1em\"><strong>MAG: 137</strong></span></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; background-color: rgba(52, 73, 94, 1); width: 19.6408%\" width=\"108\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.1em\"><strong>MEN: 35</strong></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; background-color: rgba(52, 73, 94, 1); width: 50.7443%\" colspan=\"3\" width=\"270\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.1em\"><strong><em><u>Racial Skills</u></em></strong></span></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; background-color: rgba(52, 73, 94, 1); width: 48.9485%\" colspan=\"3\" width=\"270\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.1em\"><strong><em><u>Active Skills</u></em></strong></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; background-color: rgba(52, 73, 94, 1); width: 50.7443%\" colspan=\"3\" width=\"270\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.1em\"><strong><em><u>Passive Skills</u></em></strong></span></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; background-color: rgba(52, 73, 94, 1); width: 48.9485%\" colspan=\"3\" width=\"270\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.1em\"><strong><em><u>General Skills</u></em></strong></span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<p>We round the hall heading in the direction of the training field, at which point my sister, Astrid, pauses slightly, only to continue walking again. And as she does so, I find the reason she had paused.</p>\n<p>Great. The nuisance.</p>\n<p>I subtly slow my steps to build up a little bit of a distance, totally not abandoning my sister to her would-be suitor as I focus on my General Skills.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>[General Skills]</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>|<u>Pain Resistance</u> Level 3(46%)(T1)|</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>|<u>Swordsmanship</u> Level 5(57%)(T1)|</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>|<u>First Aid</u> Level 3(61%)(T1)|</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>|<u>Stealth</u> Level 3(21%)(T1)|</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>|<u>Mana Manipulation</u> Level 5(62%)(T1)|</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>|<u>Archery</u> Level 3(31%)(T1)|</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>|<u>Survival</u> Level 4(25%)(T1)|</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>|<u>Student</u> Level 3(29%)(T1)|</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>|<u>Healing Magic</u> Level 4(71%)(T1)|</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>|<u>Enhancement Magic</u> Level 5(20%)(T1)|</strong></p>\n<p>Hmm. Got a few percentage points for Student from that class.</p>\n<p>Not bad. Even if it was boring.</p>\n<p>I understand that learning about plants can be helpful when you\u2019re out in the wild. I really do. But I don\u2019t care about plants.</p>\n<p>Nothing against the photosynthesizing sources of oxygen, but I just don\u2019t care about them.</p>\n<p>My thoughts about plants are interrupted when I hear Rodrick, some noble son of a Baron, trying to woo Astrid again as my sister ignores his very existence and walks right by him. And I try very hard to keep a straight face at the sight of the idiot tripping when he tries in a rush to catch up with her.</p>\n<p>Yeah, that didn\u2019t turn out very well for him. But it\u2019s probably for the best. He\u2019ll likely leave after embarrassing himself like that.</p>\n<p>While noble children do have quite a bit of power if they pester their parents, they don't have much sway in the academy. Since all the academy really cares about is making powerful people who might serve the kingdom.</p>\n<p>It's also one of the reasons why the first mission we were given this year was a bandit hunting mission.</p>\n<p>After the noble kid makes it back to his feet, he glances at me with a frown and then shakes his head before walking away, taking a different hallway than the one we\u2019re taking to get to the training field.</p>\n<p>Yep. Thought so.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s honestly rather annoying, but at least he doesn\u2019t push things too far. A typical noble in a lot of ways.</p>\n<p>I quickly catch up to Astrid to find her looking at me with a raised brow. But I just shrug.</p>\n<p>The number of times he\u2019s mistaken me for Astrid is already annoying enough and makes things quite awkward in general. Although I don\u2019t really blame him.</p>\n<p>I glance at my sister, who looks identical to me in just about every way. The main telling sign of who\u2019s who between us being that I wear my hair in a braid while she doesn\u2019t, simply letting her long black hair flow straight. We also have the same blue eyes and are both the same height of about five foot five inches tall. Not to mention that our armor is identical.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen are you going to deal with him?\u201d I ask with a light frown. But she just shrugs and says, \u201cI don\u2019t really want to cause Gramps any trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hmm. Guess she\u2019s right there.</p>\n<p>Idiot or not, that nuisance is still the son of a Baron.</p>\n<p>Can\u2019t be too rude to the guy without him raising a fuss. Not that Gramps would have any trouble dealing with them, but it would be annoying, and I don\u2019t want to make him deal with it in the first place.</p>\n<p>I reach into my bag to grab my phone before looking at the time, then I put it back away again and stretch a little as we walk.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou warmed up yet?\u201d I ask her, since we\u2019ll need to be as prepared as possible for the dungeon dive. If we don\u2019t want to die that is.</p>\n<p>She just nods, ever the quiet and stoic type.</p>\n<p>We continue walking through the halls of the academy building in silence until we finally make it to the training field where dozens of other students are already waiting.</p>\n<p>\u201cFind your assigned group and wait with them,\u201d the instructor for our Dungeons class calls out when he sees us, the young looking man with bright red hair appearing slightly annoyed at having to deal with so many students at once.</p>\n<p>I pull my phone out before going to the class\u2019s website to find my assigned group, soon finding the groups to be in alphabetical order by last name for some stupid reason. Or at least, stupid until I realize that we\u2019re separated into combat categories along with the alphabetical order.</p>\n<p>Either way though, it leaves me and Astrid in the same group. Which is good.</p>\n<p>She tugs on my arm slightly, bringing my attention to her before she points at a group standing off to the side consisting of four people. One of which is currently waving at us with a smile on their face, his black and blue robes swaying slightly in the wind as he leans his staff tipped with a crystal at the end against a rock.</p>\n<p>Aidan. Didn\u2019t expect him to be in our group.</p>\n<p>The man is the same age as us at 20 years old, albeit just a few months older. Something he used to like pointing out to us back when we were kids and he was losing an argument. But he stopped doing that a few years back, when we were around fifteen or sixteen years old, and hasn\u2019t done it since.</p>\n<p>He does still point out how much taller he is sometimes though. Which is annoying.</p>\n<p>As we walk, I glance at the others in the group to find people I don\u2019t actually recognize. One of them has red hair and looks similar to the instructor though, so that\u2019s interesting. And she looks rather impatient too as she repeatedly rubs the pommel of her sword, the girl wearing a simple set of red armor matching her hair color with an equally red sheath.</p>\n<p>The other two are happily chatting amongst themselves, either showing that they know each other, or that they\u2019re just very friendly people in general. Although they couldn\u2019t be more different in attire. The boy is wearing a blue robe and has a staff, likely denoting him to be a light magic healer, and the girl is wearing dark green leather armor and has a bow draped over her shoulder and a quiver sitting on the ground next to her full of arrows.</p>\n<p>After we get within a couple meters of the group, the healer and archer interrupt their conversation to look over at us, and the other swordswoman girl does the same. And right away, they all look between the two of us for a few seconds before the swordswoman girl starts ignoring us and the two chatty people walk up to us.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi! I\u2019m Shelly, and this is Rob,\u201d the archer girl says while indicating the healer next to her with a smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cAstrid,\u201d my sister says, and I answer a second later, \u201cAlexia.\u201d</p>\n<p>The two look between us for a second, likely trying to figure out how they\u2019ll tell us apart in the future, before their gazes finally land on our hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re identical twins,\u201d Aidan comments from the side as he joins us.</p>\n<p>And that sets the two off, asking question after question and quickly making me realize they\u2019re chatter boxes and very curious.</p>\n<p>Probably some of my sister\u2019s least favorite types of people, so I answer the questions for her as we get settled in waiting for it to be evening.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>After the appointed time comes, we all gather up for a brief discussion from the instructor on how everything will go. The whole \u2018don\u2019t get yourself killed, the instructors can\u2019t help you inside due to the limited number of people allowed in each instance, and make sure you know each other\u2019s general abilities and levels\u2019 thing the instructor \u2013 who told us to call him that instead of professor \u2013 says in a lot of our classes.</p>\n<p>Then we get a few minutes to plan as a group before we\u2019re all teleported to the dungeon entrance, a large cave with a fancy looking entrance that looks like some sort of ancient ruins with various pillars outside and a large, round stone door that slides open when we arrive to reveal a purplish blue portal made by the System leading to the dungeon itself.</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone enter with your groups, and make sure to leave a few seconds between each group entering,\u201d the instructor says, his voice carrying over the entire clearing in front of the dungeon. \u201cEnter in order of the highest ranking group.\u201d</p>\n<p>With that, I notice several groups formed up of nobles including one with the crown prince of this kingdom lining up in front of the dungeon first. Then after that the children of the higher Tiered individuals of the kingdom who aren\u2019t nobles, which technically includes us even if we\u2019re not his biological kids, line up next. And lastly, behind us, the few groups of people who barely managed to scrape their way into the academy line up at the end.</p>\n<p>The line progresses into the dungeon group by group until it\u2019s our turn, at which point I draw my sword from its sheath alongside my sister the moment before we enter, finding ourselves quickly teleported into a place akin to a castle\u2019s dungeon. Just one full of skeletons.</p>\n<p><strong>{Skeleton \u2013 Level 11 \u2013 A low level undead summoned by a higher leveled undead.}</strong></p>\n<p><strong>{Skeleton \u2013 Level 13 \u2013 A low level undead summoned by a higher leveled undead.}</strong></p>\n<p><strong>{Skeleton \u2013 Level 14 \u2013 A low level undead summoned by a higher leveled undead.}</strong></p>\n<p><strong>{Skeleton \u2013 Level 12 \u2013 A low level undead summoned by a higher leveled undead.}</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone, form up!\u201d the red haired girl whose name is Alara and turned out to be the instructor\u2019s daughter shouts with her own sword drawn and covered in flames. \u201cAidan, Rob, and Shelly, stay at the middle of the group! Astrid, watch their backs! Alexia, with me in the front!\u201d</p>\n<p>We all follow her orders strictly because she clearly knows what she\u2019s doing. Especially after showing her planning during the few minutes we were given earlier.</p>\n<p>Then we begin cutting down the skeletons with ease. Mostly due to their low levels as they can\u2019t even break past my Mana Barrier. A passive skill all Magic Knights get.</p>\n<p><strong>[Level 11 Skeleton Defeated \u2013 User\u2019s earned EXP has been significantly reduced due to killing a being whose level is far lower than their own with assistance.]</strong></p>\n<p><strong>[Level 12 Skeleton Defeated \u2013 User\u2019s earned EXP has been significantly reduced due to killing a being whose level is far lower than their own with assistance.]</strong></p>\n<p><strong>[Level 14 Skeleton Defeated \u2013 User\u2019s earned EXP has been significantly reduced due to killing a being whose level is far lower than their own with assistance.]</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Time passes as we cut our path through the dungeon, the monsters gradually getting stronger with each floor until we finally find a real challenge on the fourth floor.</p>\n<p><strong>{Skeletal Necromancer \u2013 Level 37 \u2013 A higher undead with the intelligence of a lower ranked sapient.

And I join her while using my enhancement magic to enhance my body beyond what would normally be possible at my level. \u201cShelly, distract the necromancer. Wound him if you can!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGot it!\u201d both of them shout, following which Alara continues while cutting her flaming sword straight through the bones of one of the skeletons, lighting the thing already weak to fire magic on fire, \u201cRob, you know what to do. And Astrid, protect those three.\u201d</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t bother giving me any orders as I\u2019m already alongside her fighting the skeletons with my blade, parrying one hit after another before cutting into their weak spots, their joints, and removing entire limbs from play.</p>\n<p>Overall, I\u2019m rather pleased with my group. Although I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Gramps had something to do with putting us in a good group.</p>\n<p>Aidan performs some chant thing that\u2019s required for the particular skill he\u2019s using, a short one at least, before a wave of ice mana shoots out of him and freezes just the lower halves of the skeletons around us, giving me the opportunity to sprint through them towards the necromancer. And while the necromancer doesn\u2019t exactly like my actions, all it manages to do about it is send several necrotic bolts of death mana at me that I simply cut through with my enhancement mana enhanced sword before I eventually make it to the fragile skeleton and cut its head off entirely, quickly crushing it under my boot afterwards.</p>\n<p>The skeleton tries to attack me despite its head being destroyed, but it gets a flaming arrow to the chest from Shelly in the attempt, setting it and its black cloak on fire with a screech. Then all of the other skeletons begin losing control of themselves, their guiding hand having fallen in a pile of ashes to the ground.</p>\n<p>Which gives Alara the perfect opportunity to set them all ablaze with a powerful arc of fire that just barely goes over my head by the time it reaches me.</p>\n<p><strong>[Level 37 Skeletal Necromancer Defeated \u2013 User\u2019s earned EXP has been increased by a small amount due to killing a being whose level is above their own with assistance.]</strong></p>\n<p>Shouldn't be long before we find a boss where I can finally start getting some System equipment from an actual dungeon instead of just lower end equipment made by a lower level crafter. It isn't very rare after all, so I should get something.</p>\n<p>After looking around for a few seconds and finishing off the last few skeletons, I sheathe my sword and pop my neck before walking over to join the others. But before I reach them, I notice something odd in the corner of the room. So I draw my sword again, making the others tense up after they\u2019d just relaxed a bit.</p>\n<p>I slowly make my way over to the corner before standing in front of what looks like an odd rift in reality. Like a tiny little hole in the middle of the air that\u2019s glowing with purple and blue colors.</p>\n<p>Trying to identify it doesn\u2019t give me any sort of result though, which is odd in and of itself.</p>\n<p>\u201cLexi?\u201d I hear Astrid ask, bringing my gaze to find her standing a couple meters away from me with a frown on her face. \u201cIs everything alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>That has me frowning harder as I glance at the rift which is very obviously in the corner of the room before looking at her and asking while pointing at the thing, \u201cYou don\u2019t see this?\u201d</p>\n<p>She and the others all share a glance with each other, only to look at me again and shake their heads. Then Alara glances at Rob and says, \u201cCheck her for the effects of any mental skills the necromancer may have used.\u201d</p>\n<p>He nods and walks to me, using some sort of skill that makes a golden light shine over me, giving me a warm feeling. But then he looks at Alara with a frown and says, \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Out of nowhere, I feel a sudden urge to touch the rift. An urge that feels unnatural even to me, but I can\u2019t resist it.</p>\n<p>Almost as if my hand is driven by something other than myself, it reaches out and touches the tiny rift, following which a large flash of violet and dark purple light shines out of it and I suddenly find myself in some strange laboratory. Or at least, that\u2019s the only thing I can think of it being, considering the many signs pointing towards that conclusion. Such as the large glass cylinders and the tables and counters each with different tools and some vials of liquid.</p>\n<p>But what catches my attention the most is the person floating in the middle of the large cylindrical tank in the center of the lab staring at me with their strange eyes. The person doesn\u2019t look to be having a pleasant time and for some reason has tubes strapped and digging into their body all over. Meanwhile their eyes themselves are varying shades of purple with some flickers of blue. But what strikes me as odd about them is that they\u2019re flickering as if they were a glitch in a video game.</p>\n<p>And it\u2019s not just their eyes. The blood I see flowing out of the tubes also looks to be glitching for some reason. Even their hair, which is black with a strong tint of purple, appears to have some minor glitching once in a while. Although nowhere near as much as their eyes.</p>\n<p>Like this person isn\u2019t fully in reality or something.</p>\n<p>Weird.</p>\n<p>They also appear to be in intense pain if the look in their eyes and the occasional groaning I hear is anything to go by.</p>\n<p>I try to identify him despite knowing it\u2019s generally considered rude to identify another sapient person without having their permission or being their enemy. Because I\u2019m simply too curious about this.</p>\n<p><strong>{The System\u2019s Architect \u2013 Class: Quantum Architect \u2013 Undetermined Level \u2013 The creator of the System and the architect of the universe and the quantum realm itself.

Which is a much lighter punishment than the one he put on himself, which is far worse than just death, but who cares about that.</p>\n<p><strong>\u201cYou may ask,\u201d </strong>the being says, his voice suffused in pain.</p>\n<p>I move up to one of the tables and sit on it while meeting his rather disturbing eyes as I ask, \u201cConsidering what your identify result told me, why aren\u2019t the Ascendants still experimenting on you?\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>\u201cThey realized it was a fruitless endeavor as a being from the natural plane cannot become a quantum being without already having a quantum affinity and the System\u2019s direct interference,\u201d </strong>the being states, his eyes practically drilling into me with their pain. <strong>\u201cFurthermore, there was no way to force me to make the System obey while I am in the void and sending me out of the void would free me from their grasp to take revenge.\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>Okay. That makes sense.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t they just kill you after failing?\u201d I ask, curious about that.</p>\n<p><strong>\u201cThey fear the System may fall apart without me still being alive, which will not happen,\u201d </strong>he explains, making me purse my lips.</p>\n<p>Well, that\u2019s certainly something to think about. Not like I have a choice in killing him anymore, but certainly something.</p>\n<p>Then again, assuming the System does survive, I should at least get a legendary feat for doing this. Which will be very nice.</p>\n<p>I blink at the realization of that.</p>\n<p>A legendary feat. One that will be broadcast to the entire universe.</p>\n<p>Meaning it\u2019ll spill the beans to everyone that I killed him.</p>\n<p>Shit.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I get a legendary feat from killing you, will everyone hear about it?\u201d I ask, feeling a little bit of panic set in as I realize just how screwed I am here.</p>\n<p>He blinks slowly and answers, <strong>\u201cI will have the System hide the feat from the universe.\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>Oh. Assuming I can trust him, which I\u2019m kind of doubting, there goes that problem.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd why did you choose to bring me here instead of someone else?\u201d I ask, knowing that if he could force me here, he could probably force others.</p>\n<p><strong>\u201cBecause while it may be the worst possible Class of affinity, Class E, you do have an affinity with the quantum element, and no one else near the rift I made had any amount of quantum affinity to be able to see the rift and interact with it,\u201d </strong>he answers, startling me into silence for a few moments.</p>\n<p>I\u2026 what? That shouldn\u2019t be possible\u2026 no one has ever had that affinity before that I know of!</p>\n<p><strong>\u201cWhile it is an extremely rare affinity, people have had it,\u201d </strong>he states, proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that he can read my mind. <strong>\u201cBut those born on the natural plane have no ability to control the element even if they have the affinity, so they\u2019re only able to have the worst Class of affinity in it.\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>Before I can ask anything else, I feel my hand reaching for my sword on its own before drawing the blade.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cI haven\u2019t finished asking my questions!\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>\u201cYou only asked me to answer some of your questions,\u201d </strong>he states, making my eyes widen. <strong>\u201cAnd I agreed. But the rest of the questions you have are not things I wish to answer.\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>I try to shout, but I can\u2019t move my mouth anymore.</p>\n<p>Damned bastard! I still haven\u2019t asked anything important!</p>\n<p>Maybe if I ask them in my head?</p>\n<p>Why did you create the System? What are the consequences for the System should you die?</p>\n<p>My feet reach down, and I jump off the table onto the ground against my will.</p>\n<p>Okay, should\u2019ve guessed that wouldn\u2019t work.</p>\n<p>I try to use my skills to fight against the compulsion, but nothing I try to do works.</p>\n<p>Why the hell did he even make me swear an oath if he was just going to do this anyways?! Just to toy with me?</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t get the feeling that he was lying when he answered the questions that he did, especially since his answers make sense. But can I really trust that feeling considering that he\u2019s forcefully controlling my body right now?</p>\n<p>No matter how hard I struggle or how much mana I expend, nothing works. I just keep stepping towards the man in the tank. And before I can think of anything else I could possibly try to break free, my sword arm strikes forward in a thrust, cutting through the glass and into the center of his chest, his health stat clearly being at zero if someone of my level can even hurt him.</p>\n<p><strong>\u201cThank you, Alexia Knight,\u201d </strong>his voice echoes in my head one last time. <strong>\u201cI wish you luck in the new dimension.\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>I blink at that in confusion, but a loud shattering sound echoes throughout the laboratory, and quite possibly the rest of the universe. Then a legendary feat echoes in my head the moment the light leaves the man\u2019s eyes and they stop flickering, his body slumping while being held in place by the tubes.</p>\n<div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; background-color: rgba(3, 0, 0, 1); border-color: rgba(3, 0, 0, 1); border-style: outset; width: 78.5911%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 100%\" width=\"330\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.3em; color: rgba(253, 0, 0, 1)\"><strong>Legendary Feat \u2013 The Reaping</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.1em; color: rgba(253, 0, 0, 1)\"><strong>Alexia Knight has slain the System\u2019s Architect, also known as the Quantum Architect, and the Architect of both the Universe and Quantum Realm themselves.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.1em; color: rgba(253, 0, 0, 1)\"><strong> </strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.1em; color: rgba(253, 0, 0, 1)\"><strong>Note: This Legendary Feat has been locked within the Ascendant\u2019s Laboratory and will only play out to those inside of the Laboratory within the Void.</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<p>I let out a sigh of relief at the sight of the note on the feat.</p>\n<p>Guess he was telling the truth about that part after all.</p>\n<p>Wait a second.

I knew I was supposed to move towards the light, but I couldn\u2019t help but consider what that meant leaving behind. Truthfully, for me, there wasn\u2019t much holding me back. I was 34 years old, single, and working a job that I didn\u2019t have any passion for. I wasn\u2019t close with any friends and didn\u2019t have much of a relationship with my family. My dog, who was my closest companion, had passed away the year before. My days were empty and my evenings were lonely, with my leftover free time meaninglessly spent on games and entertainment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With nothing to lose, I pushed forward into the light, and was born again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Being a baby again was an odd experience. I couldn\u2019t really hold on to a thought, and my emotions would oscillate wildly between hunger, sleepiness, discomfort, and temporary satisfaction. As my eyesight improved, I came to recognize the faces of my parents, and attached them to the voices I had started to discern meaning out of. As I grew, I started to gain control of my movements, slowly at first and then much more rapidly until I could walk for increased amounts of time. I started to find my voice, and slowly the meaning of language came back to me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In all this time I knew, broadly, that I had been reincarnated, and that I retained memories of my old life. However, it was like there was this fog that I couldn\u2019t quite penetrate. Was it because my brain wasn\u2019t developed enough yet? Or was it that this brain didn\u2019t have sufficient language skills to parse my own memories? I wondered how that would even work, when I had moments of clarity enough to consider anything at all; how could I have memories without the neural structure to support them, in the first place? Was that proof of a soul? I hadn\u2019t even believed in the existence of souls in my previous life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As an infant, long-term memory was my primary problem. I found myself repeating the same patterns of thoughts because I wasn\u2019t yet able to remember my own former considerations on my new reality. I was increasingly able to think about my situation for longer periods of time and, slowly but surely, found myself remembering the thoughts I had on it previously.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">From the outside, my parents would say that I was a reasonably well behaved child, but not necessarily out of the ordinary. I learned fast, although as their first child they didn\u2019t have that much of a basis of comparison, so they didn\u2019t think I was particularly beyond the norm. I learned their names\u2013Horg, my father, and Sharma, my mother\u2013and also learned my own name: Pilus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sometime between the ages of three and four, the fog lifted. My family had gone to the beach for a picnic and an afternoon of play. It was after lunch when I looked down at my hands, the small hands of a young boy, and with startling clarity I recalled my adult hands of my former life. I remembered my accident, my death, my former life, my language, my knowledge, and knew that it was all different from my current life, language, and knowledge. I assumed then that I had developed enough neural framework and language capacity to maintain this train of thought. I was finally forming long-term memories. I heaved a deep sigh and tried to sort out what I knew.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What I knew about my present reality: against all odds, I had reincarnated. Or, it was at least against all that I had thought I had known from my previous life. Perhaps everyone reincarnated after all, and the only thing that was unusual was my retained memories. I would need to more carefully consider the nature of reality and the universe when I could acquire more information to figure out more. I established that I had not reincarnated in the same time as I had died: the technology level on display in my home and town was primitive, at best. While primitive, it clearly wasn\u2019t poverty; my family seemed to do well enough, we didn\u2019t lack for food or clothing, and everyone I met seemed healthy. This world seemed peaceful, too. My first long-term memory from this world would be an afternoon picnic with my parents at the beach. This couldn\u2019t be a world that just recently collapsed. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to believe that I had reincarnated into the past, since time normally only flows forward. Could civilization have collapsed long ago, and this was far into the future, after humanity had recovered some semblance of social decorum?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">My first clue was the language I had learned as I had grown up. I knew off the bat that it wasn\u2019t a language from my time, at least none of the ones I would have been capable of recognizing. I was no polyglot in my previous life, but I was worldly enough. I had seen plenty of foreign films, and would have recognized if it were any of the romance, Slavic, or Nordic languages, which given the facial structure and complexion of my parents seemed the most logical. What was more, I couldn\u2019t recognize any of the prefixes or suffixes, I picked up on absolutely zero loan-words, and the grammar was completely different. Since we were at the beach, and not on a vacation, this was a seaside town; I had a pretty good grasp of the geography of Earth, and knew the coasts well enough. This couldn\u2019t just be a sufficiently remote country I had never heard of, so this must be very, very far into the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Unless this wasn\u2019t Earth at all.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If I was being honest, I was already hoping that might be the case. I had been a big fan of reincarnation stories before my death, as well as stories of heroes being whisked away, summoned across worlds. Otherworlders would bring strength or knowledge to the new world and save it, or themselves, or both. The notion of reincarnating into a magical fantasy world was already pretty well ingrained into my head, but this was my reality now and I wanted to approach it as reasonably as possible. It wasn\u2019t like I was summoned here, fully-formed and with magical or overpowered cheat abilities. I had to learn to speak and understand words as an infant; I wasn\u2019t gifted some otherworldly language comprehension abilities. I had never seen magic\u2026</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Wait</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. I shut my eyes and rolled back my memories, new as they were, as far back as I could. We had come to the beach to have an early summer\u2019s day picnic. Before we ate, my mother and I played in the cold shallows of the sea while father watched from the beach. I had run around a bit chasing bubbles my mother blew, and once I was tired, we ate lunch. After lunch, I remembered my reincarnation. Something about this picture wasn\u2019t right, but I couldn\u2019t place it. Was it the food? The water? The\u2026</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The bubbles</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. I hadn\u2019t chased traditional soap bubbles full of air blown by my mother, like I might have as a child in my old life. They had been floating globules of water. When they popped, they splashed me. They contained a sufficient amount of water that would have been impossible to be floating around under their own power. And since there was no technology at play, that could only mean one thing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The orbs of water were magic. This world had magic!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I turned on the beach, looked towards the water, and took an excited breath as I clenched my tiny hands into tiny fists. The sea breeze whipped my messy black hair back and forth, the salt in the air stinging my blue eyes which were wide with excitement. I couldn\u2019t wait to explore the possibilities. If my mother could do magic, that boded well for me, as well. I raised my eyes to the sky as my brain swam with a newfound excitement, and, </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">oh</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2013</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Over the horizon of the ocean sat a massive gas giant, a burnt orange orb with bright purple rings which occupied a huge portion of the otherwise clear blue sky.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ok, so, this definitely wasn\u2019t Earth.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">* * *</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Over the next few months, I sometimes found myself falling back into a youthful stupor, not necessarily forgetting my situation but simply so distracted by the wealth of new experience that my growing brain was overwhelmed. It was an odd feeling, having adult memories and an adult\u2019s knowledge and logic but being swept along by the whims of a child\u2019s brain. It begged the question how any of this was possible, but then, in my former life, magic wasn\u2019t possible either.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In fact, magic broke just about every law of physics I knew. If the rules of reality were broken, I had to wonder, was any of this real at all? Was this an extended misfiring of my dying brain? Was my current life and existence real, but my former life and all my memories from it just some kind of defect with my current brain? No, that couldn\u2019t be right. I clearly carried some knowledge I shouldn\u2019t be able to have from past experiences that this version of me never had. I would have to do some experimentation to be absolutely sure, but at the very least, I had knowledge of arithmetic that I could do already that I would not be able to do as an almost-four year old, such as multiplication, which I could prove to be true just by counting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Maybe this was a simulation. After all, I could not prove that my previous life was not a simulation. A well-known philosopher, Nick Bostrom, popularized the simulation hypothesis in my former world, which suggested that all of our existence could simply be the product of a simulation of a sufficiently advanced civilization and that we would have no way of knowing. Of course, that didn\u2019t necessarily change the meaning of one\u2019s own life, but it might explain how I could now exist in the form that I currently do.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That was unlikely to be provable one way or the other. Of course, while I was regularly curious about how the universe came to be and what it all meant during my previous life, it rarely affected my day to day. I would likely have to accept that I would never understand how or why I was reincarnated. As this was a world where magic was real, one could assume that the presence of magic here allowed for reincarnation to have happened. If there existed a world that could summon people from other worlds, or at an even larger scale, if there existed a universe that could summon people from other universes, it did not necessarily need to obey the laws of the target world or universe at all.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thinking this through, especially before the age of four, regularly gave me a headache. The important part for me was understanding enough about the nature of my reality in order to use that knowledge to better myself and my situation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It was not like my former life was bad, per se. It was just disappointing. I had regrets, and those regrets started coming up pretty early in my life. This was a new opportunity, and while one cannot protect from all future regret, I wanted to do everything I could to get ahead. Whether or not this was some kind of simulation or game or another kind of reality altogether, I simply wanted to close the gap between what I knew and what I didn\u2019t even know that I didn\u2019t know, before I missed out on any chances.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Was this a game? I thought back to specific reincarnation stories that I knew of from my former life. It was usually stories of summoned heroes who would get stats displays and skill boards, but I was sure I had watched one or two reincarnation shows where the main characters could see their own stats. Usually it involved a simple incantation, like saying \u201cdisplay status\u201d or \u201ccharacter sheet\u201d something similar, and it would appear in their vision. Of course, if this were a PC game and an RPG, I would probably tap the profile key. As I envisioned my old computer\u2019s keyboard and thought back to the last game I played, it was probably the P key\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As I imagined myself pressing the P key in my mind\u2019s eye, my profile screen popped up right in front of me.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Pilus Horgson</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (Lv 1)</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">HP: 10/10</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">MP: 13/13</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Status: none</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">EXP: 27/100</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Skills: none</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Right after that window came up, a second window popped up that read:</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Skill acquired: Appraisal </span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I closed the pop up, which simply required a force of will, and saw that Appraisal was added to my previously non-existent skill list.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Right, so, this is some sort of game</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, I thought to myself. Then I corrected myself, because maybe I was just having a mental break of some kind. This didn\u2019t prove anything, although it certainly did suggest that this was not exactly a level of reality as I had previously expected to be living in. It also, at least to some degree, suggested that my previous reality might have been more likely to be a simulation or game as well, as my former mind and memories still existed. Some kind of data corruption, perhaps? Although I would have thought that the advanced civilization that could make these kinds of perfectly real game simulations would have solved pointer errors already. Of course, none of this ruled out the fact that my memories of my previous life themselves might be false, and they were simply programmed into this young brain for some reason.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To be honest, I put aside those questions pretty quickly. I didn\u2019t really care about the nature of reality with this screen in front of my face. Sure, I wondered a bit about how it could exist, since it wasn\u2019t a physical construct; I could put my hand through it, and my mother, who was nearby, didn\u2019t seem to see it when she glanced over to check in on me before going back to her work. My imagination was not so good that I could summon up visual hallucinations like this on my own. If I thought about a racecar, I couldn\u2019t summon up a true image of a racecar in my vision, just the usual memory of a racecar. This was some kind of magic, or technology, that was beyond explanation at the moment. Two things leapt out at me that took over my priority.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">First, that skill acquisition told me a lot. I seemed to have gained a skill through the act of doing, alone. That certainly suggested that I could unlock new skills if I could figure out how. I didn\u2019t seem to have any skills beforehand, although that didn\u2019t rule out that other people weren\u2019t born with inherent skills, and didn\u2019t tell me anything about whether or not they could also learn new skills this way. I would have to investigate more about skills somehow.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Second, and maybe more immediately important, was my EXP. I was already just over a quarter of the way to leveling up, and had not yet leveled up before. How had I gained these experience points? It was either something I did very infrequently over the last few years of being a baby and infant, and gained rare points from it, or something from the act of daily living that had diminishing returns, as otherwise I surely would have gained enough to level up already in the past nearly-four years. What even was an experience point?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I had not killed any monsters, or fulfilled any quests, so it wasn\u2019t purely a reward for some achievement that I was aware of. Taken at face value, if I gained experience points through new experiences, a child such as myself doesn\u2019t really experience all that much. A huge amount of my life so far has been sleeping, eating, and casual play. I had learned to crawl, then walk, and I had learned some motor skills, but those were pretty basic things. Perhaps I needed to try more new things to gain more experience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Except, I wasn\u2019t even four years old yet. What could I even do?</span></p>\n            </div>",

It's practically falling over\u2026\u201c Bill Wolfe, a newly-minted college dropout in the midst of a weeks long mental decline looked up at the Cosmic Exchange, a dilapidated two-story building that leaned precariously to the left. Its crumbling exterior, once vibrant and inviting, if a little on the odd side, had been painted to resemble the vastness of outer space. Sadly, it was at least a decade past needing a touch-up. Faded planets and constellations adorned its facade, now peeling and worn, revealing termite-eaten wooden slats that formed the skeleton of the building.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With a shake of his head, Bill reminded himself that what he really needed to do was save money. Although it was undeniable that this peculiar resale shop should've been condemned years ago, according to a few online reviews he'd read the night before, this was going to be his best shot at finding an inexpensive couch. So long as he could put up with the eccentric owner.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Should probably look for a table while I'm at it</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He didn't need anything special, just a few odds and ends that would endure his two month stay in town. After that, the bums were welcome to it for all he cared.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Locating some comfortable furniture would be great, but he was going to settle for whatever he could find. \"Not like I'll be having any company over...\" He grimaced, fighting down a wave of emotion that threatened to drive him back to hiding out in the gloomy confines of his tiny apartment. Bill took a deep breath and gently closed the door of his trusty old Jeep, and eyed the rickety structure warily, fearful that with the way his luck was going, a gust of wind might actually send it toppling onto his head.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Determined to stay on budget, he brushed off the uncomfortably realistic concern and approached the shadowed entryway, determined to find something that fit his needs. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Anything beats sitting on the floor.</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Just as he reached the doorway, a cloud of cigarette smoke materialized, accompanied by a round of hacking coughs. Emerging from the shadows was an old lady, her pale skin, weathered and shriveled like an ancient piece of vellum. Varicose veins spiderwebbed down her legs in various shades of greens and blues, eerily reminiscent of a GPS map. She could've been 65 or 120. Oftentimes Bill found it really hard to tell with old ladies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cMy eyes are up here sonny,\u201d she said, her voice carrying a hint of a Texan accent. Unappreciative of the scrutiny, the old crone exhaled another plume of smoke in Bill's direction, her eyes sharp and piercing as she fixed him with a contemplative stare.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"Looking for something in particular, young man? Or just admiring the view?\" the old lady asked in a raspy voice, punctuated by the rapid clicking of her lighter. Bill mustered an apologetic smile, doing his best to be friendly despite the sudden desire to vomit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"No ma'am! Just browsing, ma'am,\" he replied in a rush, his tone thick with unease. The lady's piercing eyes bore into him, seemingly dissecting his soul with each glance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"Nah, don't believe that for a second. My guess is you're here for another reason,\" she retorted, exhaling another lungful of cloying smoke. \"What's your story sonny? Who are you? Why're you here?\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bill felt his temper rising, the pain of the last few weeks having left him with an exceptionally short fuse. He hesitated for a moment, then decided to share a partial truth, heavily implying that the rest was off-limits.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"No ma'am, no special reasons. Just taking a semester off from school,\" he replied, his voice tinged with regret. \"Got some personal stuff going on. Thought I'd spend a couple of months here in San Antonio. You know, get away from my responsibilities for a while.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"Well, took your sweet time gettin' here,\" Her tone grew heavy, her eyes suddenly glazed over as if she was half asleep. Her words were unnerving, suddenly spoken with a sense of familiarity as if she had been expecting him all along. Bill furrowed his brow, feeling a twinge of confusion. He had never seen this woman in his life. Of that, there was no doubt.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"Uh, ok. Sorry if I kept you waiting. I assure you I meant no disrespect,\" he replied, averting his eyes, attempting to be polite despite his growing discomfort. \"I'm honestly just here looking for a cheap couch and possibly a table.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The old woman narrowed her eyes, studying him with an intensity that sent a chill down his spine. \u201cCouch and table, huh? Well, you've come to the right place. But remember, everything here has a price. Some are paid in cold hard cash, others in blood.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bill blinked, unsure of how to interpret her words. Assuming she was merely a lonely old lady who was quite possibly showing signs of dementia, he decided to dismiss her elusive warnings as the ramblings of an aged and weary mind. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Maybe Alzheimer's...</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"I'll, uhh, keep that in mind?\" he replied, unsure what else to say, offering a polite smile to cover his pity. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">She's obviously not in her right mind\u2026 </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"I'm just passing through town ma'am, only plan to be here for a couple of months at the most. Just trying not to break the bank. According to a few reviews I read this morning, this is my best bet to find something in my price range.\" </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Should've known better than to trust those worthless reviews\u2026 Eccentric?! This lady is bat shit crazy!</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The old lady leaned closer, her eyes narrowing. \"Money ain't the only currency in this world, young man. There are far more valuable things at stake. But suit yourself. I've no doubt you'll learn soon enough\u2026 And you better not be thinking of trying to rob a poor old lady of her treasures,\u201d she warned, wagging a finger in his direction. '\u201dI\u2019ve got my eyes on you, and I'm not as defenseless as my appearance might imply.\u201c</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bill chuckled nervously. His unease grew, but he brushed it off as paranoia. Eager to escape, he nodded politely and gently extricated himself from the conversation, entirely unsure what to expect from the contents of the peculiar store. If that crazy old lady's products matched the condition of her establishment, chances were, he was going to be leaving empty-handed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As he stepped through the creaking door, the old lady sparked up another cigarette, the lingering smoke trailing after him like a foul-smelling specter. Her eyes remained fixed on him until he disappeared from sight. \u201cSuch is fate\u2026\u201d she whispered and took a deep drag.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>***</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"Crazy owner, unsanitary conditions... Man, what a dump,\" Bill grumbled, his words laced with disdain as he surveyed the neglected surroundings, eyes slowly adjusting to the dim, musty interior. The air was heavy with the pungent scent of menthol cigarette smoke, causing him to wrinkle his nose in discomfort. As he surveyed the scene before him, a sense of revulsion settled in his gut.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The interior was disorganized and chaotic, the layout reflecting the chaos within Bill's own mind. He felt a growing resentment towards the world, repeatedly questioning the purpose of his existence. What was the point of searching for meaning when everything he touched seemed destined to fall to pieces?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Row upon row of uneven shelves were cluttered with an assortment of outdated and useless items, each one seemingly older than the last. Dust-covered trinkets, cracked porcelain figurines, oversized mechanical oddities, and faded paintings adorned every inch of the worn wooden surfaces. Cobwebs stretched across the ceiling like a thick fog, swaying gently with every movement of air.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bill hesitated, looking around with disgust, reluctant to touch anything. He pulled his shirt up to cover his nose and mouth, hoping to shield himself from the layers of dust that had settled on every surface. It was disgusting. The shop seemed frozen in time, a veritable warehouse of worthless junk from the past.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The back of his neck started to itch. \u201cNo wonder the owner stays outside\u2026 This is fucking gross.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As Bill cautiously navigated his lanky frame through the narrow aisles, footsteps being drowned out by the creaking floorboards, he couldn't help but wonder how a place like this could even manage to stay in business. In fact, the only reason he hadn't already walked out came down to being severely limited on resources. Most of the items on display were filthy, but they had price tags barely exceeding a few dollars. Splurging on cleaning chemicals hadn't been in the initial plan, but so long as he could get a couch for cheap enough it was still financially doable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As he walked around a pointless wall built in the middle of the room for no apparent reason, Bill finally saw what he came to find. Furniture. And a lot of it. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now we're getting somewhere</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. There were a wide variety of tables and chairs of all sizes lined up along the left wall. Long wooden benches unfit for anything outside of a church were placed opposite, haphazardly stacked against the right side. The entire middle was nothing but couches, at least twenty of them, each with ornate wooden armrests and upholstery that often depicted flowers in one shape or another. The only problem was most of it looked to be a hundred or more years old! Not only were they layered in filth, they had to weigh hundreds of pounds each. There was no way he could get even the smallest one up to his second story apartment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Just as he decided to leave, Bill's gaze settled on an old wooden wardrobe tucked away in a dimly lit corner. Its once polished surface was now marred by scratches and caked with grime. When he saw that the price tag was a whopping five dollars, Bill's curiosity piqued. For some reason he couldn't explain, he felt drawn to it, as if he had encountered this wardrobe in a childhood dream or forgotten memory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Approaching the wardrobe with caution, he resisted the temptation to run his fingers along its surface. The thought of the dust caking under his nails sent a shiver down his spine. Brushing aside his misgivings, Bill gripped the ornate handle with a shirt-wrapped hand and pulled the door open. The rusty hinges squealed in response.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Inside, behind a scattering of moth-eaten coats and worn lace dresses, his eyes fell upon a ridiculously ornate mirror. Unlike everything else in this shit hole of a store, it didn't have a price tag. It was mounted to the wardrobe's back wall, filling up nearly the entire surface. The mirror's frame was fashioned out of a gleaming wood so dark it appeared to be black. Exceptionally detailed carvings of strange animals adorned the outer edge, each one easily distinguishable from the next, but unlike any he had ever seen depicted.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Unfortunately, the most important part, the reflective surface, was tarnished and a long crack split across it diagonally, attesting not only to mistreatment but also the passage of many, many years. Although damaged beyond repair, there was still an unmistakable allure to it, as if it held secrets that transcended its physical form. Just how many people had looked into this mirror over the ages? How many were still alive to this day?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bill's reflection stared back at him, distorted by the cracks and imperfections. Unkempt, greasy black hair stuck out at all angles, framing a gaunt face that, thanks to his mixed Native American and European heritages, was far too long and angular to be considered good-looking. At least by modern day rugged manly standards.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">High cheekbones jutted out over a nose that was rather large and hawkish. Bill's lips, although currently chapped and dry, were still a bit too full for those of a man. His friends back home liked to joke that his features were reminiscent of a Harpy; those mystical bird women regarded as the 'hounds of mighty Zeus'.</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> I probably smell like one too\u2026 My clothes are a bit ripe\u2026 I really need a shower\u2026</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"Why bother? Not like I've got anyone waiting at home\u2026 It's not like Sara is comi\u2026 No. No, That's enough. She wouldn't want me feeling like this\u2026\" he muttered under his breath, his voice heavy with bitterness.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The more he stared into the depths of the mirror, the more he couldn't shake the feeling that something about his image seemed off, as if it wasn't merely a reflection but a glimpse into an alternate version of himself. His own face, etched with weariness and uncertainty, seemed to flicker for a moment, revealing a worrisome darkness lurking just beneath the surface.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As he leaned in closer, his breath fogged the glass, making the crack stand out even further. Bill noticed a circular black smudge on the mirror\u2019s surface, situated so that it was placed at the center of his neck, right above his Adams apple. He rubbed at his throat, but the stubborn stain was still there. Without thinking, Bill reached out to touch the mirror.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In that instant, a thunderous crack filled the air. The mirror exploded outwards as if in slow motion, each tiny fragment reflecting a miniscule image of his his vacant expression transforming into a scrunched up mask of sheer terror. Heartbeat pounding in his temples, Bill tried to duck down and shield his head but his body refused to respond to his urgings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The flow of time returned to normal when a jolt of searing fire ripped through his neck. He felt a dull <em>crunch </em>as the bones in his throat cracked under an immense amount of pressure. </span>Bill tried to scream, but the pitiful sound that parted his lips was more like what he'd expect from pulling a boot out of deep mud.</p>\n<p>An avalanche of scarlet foam geysered out of his mouth.</p>\n            </div>",

If I turn right now and run, will anyone notice? Will anyone care? </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The sky was bloody, with tons of orange turning almost red at the beginning of sunset. Alessia\u2019s head was pounding from the incredible noise coming from the horizon. When she looked at her feet, she felt the ground trembling.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With a shock, she realized that the </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> In her head was her heart increasingly beating against her chest, almost harmonizing with the beast\u2019s roar sounding in the distance. The loud noises inside and outside were contrasting with the sepulchral silence of the men and women at her side. Lines and lines of sets of armor and blades formed in a way that any General would consider perfection. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To Alessia, that was all bullshit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">She could bet her house and her children that all of the soldiers beside her were thinking the same. She was not going to run, there was no reason after all, the Lord Commander would come and finish this quickly, and soon enough she would be home with her kids. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Just another day, just another battle, just another King to be defeated by the armies of Liberation. The beast\u2019s roar was getting closer and closer, the sound of wings tearing up the air making everyone shift the weight of the body from one leg to the other. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here it comes, here it comes\u2026 </span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Then the massive shadow of the dragon covered everyone's head, Alessia looked up and saw the scales in its sinuous body, red and white all over the dragon\u2019s bulk\u2026 in some parts all scales were red and in others, white. His wings, like ones of a bat, slowly made a movement to the skies and then came faster in the direction of the ground\u2026 that moment was in some ways magnificent and terrifying, Alessia\u2019s blabber felt small in her belly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The dragon went up and covered the sun flapping his wings more rapidly to keep on the same height, then the whole army could see the creature\u2019s two big heads coming in the end of two elongated necks and both roared at the same time making a lot of soldiers cover their ears. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cIt 's him!\u201d </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Someone shouted next to Alessia, and soon others were doing the same and pointing to the sky. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A figure jumped the right neck of the dragon and kept floating in front of the beast, Lord Commander Tedros wore black armor, with a hood covering his face and a red sword floating at his side, Alessia could not see, but everyone knew that was his legendary blade, Thirsty, and the glimmering red in the sword was no metal any blacksmith could bend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It was blood. Alessia was afraid, there was no way to deny it, but it was not about the big fucking dragon or the magical bloodthirsty sword, she feared what would happen next\u2026 how many lives this day was going to rip off, and mostly if she was going to be one of the unlucky ones.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cMy comrades in arms I salute all of you!\u201d The grave voice of the Lord Commander reverberated through the whole ground, loud and powerful. The dragon and its master were above everyone and the perfect lines of soldiers were all in the base of the Hill. The enemy was waiting on the top, no question. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cToday will be our last war effort!\u201d She had listened to that not three months ago. \u201cToday we will grant peace to the World! Today our enemies will know honor and might!\u201d That he said before too. \u201cToday our blades will drink the blood of the wicked!\u201d That part always made Alessia shiver. The commander's voice dropped some levels, with almost sadness in his voice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cToday we will birth a new order, which will demand sacrifices\u2026\u201d Looked like he was talking to himself and to the army at the same time, Alessia started to listen to whisperings in the lines. \u201cCan I count on you, my comrades, to do what must be done?!\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He shouted to the air, and every soldier responded </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">at the top of their lungs, Alessia was shouting too. Her excitement didn\u2019t last long. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It's coming\u2026 it\u2019s coming\u2026 </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cIf we die today, we will die in glory! ATTACK!!!\u201d It was his time to shout as loud as he could and fly to the sky.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Alessia could see the cavalry ahead advancing on the hill. Soon enough would be her time. The Arrows were being loosened, the lines of horses were almost done and the foot soldiers were starting to move\u2026 </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">at least I\u2019m not in the front, </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and then the soldier in front of her started to run and she did the same, realizing in the end that she had just pissed herself. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Here we go to certain death!</span></em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cTHIS IS FUCKING BORING!!!\u201d He shouted high in the air. If anyone down there could listen to something, they would probably think that it was something like \u201cCharge!\u201d, \u201cAttack, my comrades in arms!\u201d </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">blah, blah, blah\u2026 I can't take this bloody war anymore. If I turn right now and run, will anyone notice? Will anyone care? Yeah, these poor bastards would probably care, but would I? Best be done with it, the great Lord Commander Tedros comes to the rescue of the peasants once more. </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">From above he could see the armies finally clashing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The cavalry had lost almost half of the men and horses to the enemy's arrows, but the other half was creating mayhem in the battlefield, from the distance was possible to see the battlefield becoming redder, like the sun\u2026 </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">all this red is making me hungry, what would I give right now for a tomato soup? </span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWhat about you, Grax? Or you, Thirsty? I bet both are hungry too, but not for a delicious soup, I suppose\u2026\u201d The dragon and the blade kept silent, but he almost could feel the impatience in the glimmering of the sword. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Zephirya was just after the enemy army. A beautiful city with enormous white buildings with rounded ceilings, like none he had seen in other parts of the world. At the end of the city was a big harbor with dozens of merchant ships. The city was alive, even in the distance Tedros could see people in the street, it did not look like they were facing the greatest threat of Maltovia. He could just fly there and make the place ashes, but he had a duty to his armies, and if he burned the city down how would he find answers? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lord Commander Tedros, Protector of the Realms, High Priest of Blood, Supreme leader of all Free Territories fixed himself in Grax\u2019s left neck and descended to the bloodbath, his blade flying by his side, zipping through the air, making a high-pitched noise and accelerating more than the two-headed beast. The dragon roared once again and this time its breath was ablaze with flames red, orange, and blue\u2026 the battlefield was alight with fire\u2026 for what Tedros could see, it was mostly enemies caught by the flames. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Dragon followed his commands, the blade not so much. The destruction it was causing could be considered holy by the church of blood, the sword made swings in all directions, never thrusting, just making grand arches and cutting everyone and everything it touched. Sprays of blood fly through the battlefield, making a beautiful image of carnage. Tedros almost smiled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThirsty, attack the enemies! The enemies!\u201d He shouted to everyone. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You can keep killing these fools all day, mine in black or his men in blue\u2026 just show me the prophet already!</span></em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Why did I come this time? I could be home resting, eating, talking with the kids\u2026 Five years must be enough. If I'm alive at the end of the day, that is it. I\u2019ll retire.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Alessia pulled the sword free from the belly of an enemy soldier, grabbed the coat, and threw the zephyrian away, by a glimpse she could see that it was a woman too\u2026 what mattered shit to Alessia, with a blue helmet the enemy gender became \u201cTarget\u201d. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">She made a big swing with the sword, cutting a neck clean and saving an ally's life just to get saved by the same man an instant after. An enemy threw a spear at her shoulder, not connecting with flesh but making her lose the ground and fall, the big man in blue rushed at her and was stopped all of a sudden by an arrow in the neck </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201c</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Grar!\u201d </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He gasped before falling to the ground holding his neck with both hands.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">She nodded to her savior and got up right before a flash of red passed above her head. A second later and Alessia would be headless. Her new friend did not get the same luck. Thirsty passed through him with such speed and savagery that the man was cut in half, gore from his belly painting the battlefield. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Time to go to the other side! </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When that blade was in battle, the preferable choice was to turn and run.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">She ran in the direction of Tedros, on the right side of the battlefield feeling secured by the mass of allied soldiers. One of the Generals was shouting orders to flank the right side and she was going to partake in that assault. It was better to stick close to the big fucking dragon than near that wicked sword. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">She looked at Tedros and thought she saw him stretching his arms like someone who can not wait to get back to sleep. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is nothing to him\u2026 he could for sure end this right now. Is it only me seeing how stupid this day became?</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As if listening for someone, a giant bird fell from the sky in the direction of the Lord Commander. The bird had white feathers and the constitution of an apex predator, with three-quarters of the size of the dragon the creature was menacing, as if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, in the edge of its wings were giant razor blades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These blades came tearing the scales and flesh of the right red head of the dragon who got caught by surprise. A Huge shriek came from the throat of the bird when it went up again, but not before putting its claw in the face of the beast.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The red head of the Dragon swung from one side to the other like a madman being bitten by one thousand ants, blood spilling from the eyes of the beast while the white head looked up following the bird with its gaze. Tedros looked up too and in an instant, they were flying fast in the direction of the bird. Far away Alessia could see the blade abandoning the battlefield and following its owner to the skies. Something was saying in Alessia\u2019s mind that the real reason they were all there was this big bird and its rider, but it was not the time to think, it was the time to kill some men in blue.</span></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cFinally! Finally some fun! Come here and kill me like I heard you can!\u201d The bird was really fast, the clouds were getting bigger and the air difficult to breathe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In a moment upon entering a cloud Tedros lost sight of the bird just to get caught by him coming on a side direction, blades in the wings tearing some scales from Grax and a little part of his armor\u2026 that was a sharp end, indeed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI don\u2019t wanna fight! I just want to talk! I\u2019m serious!\u201d His voice was echoing in the air, they were up the clouds with nothing by their side.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The bird came once again from a cloud in the direction of the Dragon. Thirsty flew in the direction of the bird and made a deep cut in his right wing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cDon\u2019t do that, you stupid sword! Don\u2019t kill it! If the bird dies it will be a pain in the ass to get to the prophet!\u201d The blade returned to his side, obeying him for a change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The bird stopped some feet away and Tedros could see the prophet in its back. All in blue, with a robe, probably made of silk, and a blade sheathed in his belt, which would help nothing in the skies. Tedros jumped from the dragon and floated in the direction of the prophet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cSo\u2026 you wanna die?\u201d The man in blue asked with curiosity in his voice, a smile taking form on his old face. Age marks showed around his eyes, and in his black skin, it was possible to see that most of his tan was from being a worker, one that got a lot of sun on the face. \u201cYou could have sent me a letter instead of an army. Would\u2019ve been more polite.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n            </div>",

The eraser scoured the hapless number from the designated box. <br><br>\u201cAre you going to wait on the customers or not?\u201d The figure wiped her hands on a grubby apron before putting them on her hips.<br><br>Sally looked up to see the short, portly figure of the diner owner, Doris, standing midway in the doorway to the kitchen. Seemingly unable to decide whether not burning the food or chastising the one waitress in the diner was the most important thing at present. Her hazel eyes were still soft despite the scowl. <br><br>\u201cThey're fine, Miss Doris, barely even moving a muscle.\u201d Sally waved her free hand towards to general horde of Sunday morning breakfasters.<br><br>Most were contently murmuring about their week or chewing through the cooked flesh and eggs the cook had drowned in grease. None of them looked particularly needful of her attention. <br><br>Doris shook her head, her grey curls bobbing about as she resigned to heading back to the fryer. \u201cJust pay attention, okay?\u201d<br><br>Sally scratched at her blonde hair and glared around the room again, seeing if anyone dared require more coffee or needed to pay their bill. None met her challenge. Sunday morning was perhaps the dullest time in the diner - anyone up this early had no right demanding such prompt service.<br><br>Resigning to double-check that there was still enough coffee to dispense, she turned around and narrowed her blue eyes at the glass pot atop the heated plate. The dark liquid inside was at an adequate level. <em>Oh</em>- Doris had mentioned she changed the coffee brand this morning due to a stock shortage. Sally turned the adjacent dark container around on the desk to read the name and wrinkled up her nose. <em>RatJuice?</em> No complaints from the customers yet\u2026 but that was terrible marketing.<br><br>She returned to her sheet and slowly filled the empty box\u2026 with the <em>same number</em> she had just erased. She exhaled and fiddled with one of the ribbons in her hair as the box was purged of numerals once again. It had taken all week to get to this point, but the character was <em>almost </em>close to being complete. It was by no means min-maxed, but everything about it had been curated to be authentic and effective. <br><br>The small sketch of her character \u2018Krunk\u2019 stared back at her in silent judgement at her indecisiveness. Krunk had it all. Strength, Charisma, and a cool hat. Probably even a suitor or five if Sally really wanted to drive home the fact that the character was just escapism from her own insecurities.<br><br>\u201cOh, what system are you playing?\u201d A voice roused her from a focused stare at the paper.<br><br>She looked to see a man, probably only a little older than her, nervously eyeing up her character sheet. He had messy brown hair and green eyes, and his shirt said <em>Goreblaster </em>on it. It looked like one of those terrible over the top, obscure band shirts with barely legible text. The usual Sunday crowd was nearer the grave, other than the occasional weekend office worker, so his sudden appearance was a surprise. <br><br>\u201cTechnically,\u201d she twirled the pencil nervously before dropping it on the floor, \u201cI am not playing\u2026 yet.\u201d<br><br>\u201cYou don't have a group?\u201d He raised his eyebrows.<br><br>The question wasn't meant to be judgemental, she knew, but Sally still recoiled mentally from her own slant on it. <br><br>\u201cI haven't been into <em>Hobgoblinicide </em>for long,\u201d she lied, mentally hiding away and drawing a curtain around the stack of books and unused characters languishing in long-forgotten piles at her house. <br><br>\u201cThat's fair,\u201d the guy rubbed the back of his neck, \u201cI'm, uh, Theo, by the way. You should come by the Card Dungeon sometime - there are a few groups you might be interested in joining.\u201d He slid money across the counter with a smile.<br><br>\u201cSally,\u201d she nodded in return, before remembering she had a name badge on. \u201cDo you have a group?\u201d<br><br>\u201cI do,\u201d he smiled, heading towards the exit, \u201cbut it's only for the <em>worthy</em>.\u201d A brief, awkward wink was the last she saw of him as he left out into the world.<br><br>Sally pursed her lips and frowned as she watched the door close behind him, rattling on its hinges. Was that a challenge, flirting, or just being condescending? In theory, whichever was the correct answer, it still made her want to try to get into the party.<br><br>Did Doris serve him earlier? She looked down at the money presented\u2014the perfect amount for the basic breakfast and all-you-can-drink RatJuice special. Sally frowned and shuffled it off into the till - surely she would have remembered serving him earlier? <br><br>Her nerves struck up, overriding her brief confidence. She didn't know anyone else going to the shop; what if she embarrassed herself? After building her ideal character for so long, what if she made a mistake or ruined it somehow? Now sitting lonely atop the counter, the character sheet seemed like a bad idea waiting to happen - an invitation to disappointment. <br><br>\u201cSally?\u201d<br><br>She startled and turned to the gruff projector of her name. It was just Reginald after some more coffee. She sighed and picked up the heated pot. <br><br>Reginald was a regular, to the point where the diner was like a second home to him - or even his first. Every day he would spend as much time as possible there, drinking coffee and slowly reading the newspaper. Always in a brown tweed suit and matching hat. Same chair. Same table. He was as much part of the furniture as the strange mammal statue Doris had placed at the end of the counter over a decade ago - not that Sally had been here that long, <em>thankfully </em>- she had no intention of working here til she died. <br><br>\u201cSorry, Reg, was miles away,\u201d she poured his fresh coffee, \u201canything good in the papers?\u201d<br><br>\u201cNever is,\u201d he shrugged glumly, \u201calways sounds like the world is ending.\u201d His tiny eyes peered out from craters of wrinkles, and his grey-flecked beard cradled a slight smile. <br><br>\u201cWell, even if it does, you still got this place.\u201d That didn't sound like a great comfort out loud, but Reginald seemed to perk up and nod in agreement. <br><br>\u201cOrder's up, Sally!\u201d A shout came from the kitchen.<br><br>The covered window to the kitchen opened up, and two plates of hot, greasy food were placed on the shelf. The sweating face of Doris peered through. \u201cTable Three!\u201d<br><br>\u201cRoger that, Miss Doris.\u201d Sally clunked the coffee pot back onto the heated plate and grabbed the two plates.<br><br>The kitchen window shut behind her with a clunk, and she sighed. It wasn't that she didn't enjoy her job. She had just been here way too long. What had started as a summer holiday job to get her more social - or at least, that's what her parents had said - had turned into a few years of waiting tables. <em>Waiting </em>to wait on tables. School had passed, and it became a full-time thing. The work was simple, and Doris paid well enough\u2026 but she <em>had </em>been languishing. <br><br>She smiled to the customers - a couple in their late middle age - a skill long practised and automatic. To an outsider, Sally was all the confidence and friendly sass that you'd expect from such a quaint, out-of-the-way diner. But inside, interacting with people was an alien concept. One that often never passed the required pleasantries of this familiar setting. If only she could kill off that part of her brain. <br><br>Sally returned to her side of the counter, <em>the safe side</em>, and squatted down to pick up the pencil. The momentary hiding spot, away from the dozen-odd customers and the persistent glare of the morning sun, was a relief. A small wall of aged wood and commercial function. The shade was almost enough to let her sales face melt away, and then the diner door swung open. She stood, ready to greet the new customer - but it was not a greying mortal intent on devouring a cooked breakfast.<br><br>The familiar unkempt boy who was the other diner worker strolled in. His shirt was untucked and his almost-black hair a messy thatch. With the amount of thin ice he skated on, he could go professional once he inevitably got fired.<br><br>\u201cWhat\u2019s with the tie, Charlie?\u201d Sally pointed at the wonky, partially loose black tie around his neck. \u201cGot an interview?\u201d<br><br>\u201cNot quite,\u201d he beamed beneath tired eyes, \u201cthey say to dress for the job you want.\u201d<br><br>Sally raised an eyebrow as he slowly walked towards the kitchen. \u201cWhat job <em>do</em> you want?\u201d<br><br>He shrugged in response. \u201cNo idea, but it\u2019ll come quicker with this on.\u201d<br><br>\u201cYou\u2019re an hour late for shift. The only thing it\u2019ll make quicker is giving Doris easy access to throttling you.\u201d<br><br>He waved her off, entering the kitchen - the muffled raised voice of Doris vibrating through the wall as she chastised his tardiness, <em>again</em>.<br><br>Sally shook her head and smiled. Charlie had only been there six months and had been a thorn in Doris\u2019 side nearly every day - it was a wonder why she kept him around, but the old owner had a soft spot for them both. In truth, she saw the boy as a little brother too. As a single child herself, it was nice to-<br><br><em>Crash</em><br><br>She turned to see the sluggish glances of the diner patrons move over to Reginald. <br><br>\u201cSo sorry, dear - I knocked the coffee off, moving my paper.\u201d<br><br>It was hard to be annoyed at the earnest apology as the old man\u2019s tiny sad eyes looked up at her. Plus, it was just a cup - it\u2019s not like anyone died. Sally grabbed the dustpan and brush and went back around to clean up. <br><br>\u201cNot to worry, Reg, let me sweep this, and I'll grab you another one.\u201d <br><br>\u201cThank you, you are too kind.\u201d<br><br>She smiled as she brushed the last of the shards together and scooped them up. Finally standing, a weird vertigo sensation made her wobble. Putting a hand on the nearby table, a frown weighed heavily on weak muscles.<br><br>\u201cOh, must have gotten up\u2026 too\u2026 fast.\u201d The words came out slurred, and as she tried to move her hand, a weird numb sensation filled every limb. Something smelt strange too, but her foggy brain couldn't place it. <br><br>Maybe she just needed some rest? <br><br>Sally closed her eyes and let the darkness take her.</p>\n            </div>",

        "chapter_content": "<div class=\"chapter-inner chapter-content\">\n                <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When death took him, Daniel wished it had been... a little cooler. He wasn\u2019t run over by a truck while saving a little girl, nor did he heroically fight off a burglar. Instead, it happened gradually - sleeping on the same hospital bed as he had been for the last four years. He had always known the day would arrive, having come to terms with his death years prior. After all, he had an abundance of time to think when bound to his bed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A week ago, his doctors had warned him he had only a few days to live, and he could feel himself growing weaker by the day, more asleep than awake. On the final day, Daniel vaguely remembered the panicked voices of both nurses and his family, but it was like a haze was distorting his memories, making them seem so far away. Regretfully, he didn\u2019t even get to say his final words. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Indeed, cancer was a silent but deadly killer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Looking back at his life, it hadn\u2019t been anything special. Born to a nice family, he spent his childhood days playing around and making friends. His baseball career was ended by a nasty wrist injury, so he redoubled his focus on studying, finishing high school with perfect grades. Before he could even apply for a university, his day-to-day life came crawling to a stop with the discovery of his illness. Daniel could remember the gut-wrenching sensation even after death. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These were the thoughts that plagued Daniel\u2019s mind as he floated around in the darkness, void of light and sound. If this was what the afterlife had to offer, he wasn\u2019t a particularly big fan. Perhaps he should\u2019ve converted to Christianity, though it was too late now.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThere you are. You\u2019re a slippery little soul, ain\u2019t ya?\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The darkness coalesced into a billowing robe of shadow, coating a figure that couldn\u2019t be seen. A scythe made of human bone idly rested in the figure\u2019s hands, paler than any shade of white he had ever witnessed. Despite being unable to see the grim reaper\u2019s expression, Daniel had the feeling it was smirking, not unlike a child gloating. How unsettling. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He waited for a few moments for fear or any sort of emotion to set in, but it was futile. The pitch-black was like a still lake, muting every sense and feeling he had. Perhaps this was even worse than nothingness or eternal sleep - an emotionless Limbo.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cAh, your soul lacks so much colour this time. Come on, liven up,\u201d Death chuckled, spinning its scythe as if it was some sort of toy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI-I think I\u2019ve forgotten how to socialise. You\u2019ll have to forgive me,\u201d Daniel said, rummaging through his mind for what to say. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Back in the day, he would be fearless, going up to everyone, trying to make friends with them. It had been years since anyone but his family had visited him. Any social norms were long forgotten. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cIt saddens me to see you like this. You were such a great man in your past life, but look at you now,\u201d the grim reaper poked him with the butt of his scythe, making him instinctively dodge. It was a futile effort, the bone passing through his body without any resistance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI was? Could you tell me a bit more about that before I truly pass away?\u201d Daniel asked, floating closer to the reaper. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Death retorted. \u201cBut, tell you what. I\u2019m going to offer you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,\u201d he floated closer to him, Daniel\u2019s eyes meeting the nothingness behind the hood. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWell, a once-per-reincarnation offer, seeing that I offered it to you last time as well. But you rejected me, so here we are.\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Perhaps if he was alive, he would feel a mixture of confusion or a bout of inquisitiveness, but in Limbo, none of those things came. His rational mind took in the facts as they were, and they floated around in his mind, waiting to be tinted by the lens of emotions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Death reached into its robe, pulling out a shimmering blue piece of papyrus. Ancient runes seared themselves into Daniel\u2019s mind, making his spirit boil and simmer. Even as his soul was getting twisted and torn to shreds, no pain accompanied it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWhoops, I forgot you can\u2019t read Treachery yet. Consider yourself lucky you don\u2019t know what the words mean,\u201d the grim reaper said, hiding the scroll from Daniel. The reaper\u2019s hand reached out, plunging itself deep inside Daniel\u2019s soul. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThere they are,\u201d it exclaimed, grabbing the searing letters. Then, the cold hand squeezed the <em>wrong </em>from both the letters and his soul. <br></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cAlright, you shouldn't go insane the moment you reincarnate now. Let me summarise instead,\u201d it said, floating above him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI\u2019m giving you a second chance at life - with these memories at least. For the duration of your next life, you\u2019ll be one of my soul collectors, taking care of stray souls that linger on too long in the mortal world. What do you think?\u201d Death said, offering its alabaster white hand to shake. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWhat\u2019s the catch?\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Deep down, it didn\u2019t matter what the catch was, but his rationality wouldn\u2019t let him immediately accept. It was only logical to get as many benefits as possible before reincarnating. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThere\u2019s no catch. Even if you die immediately upon your reincarnation, you\u2019ll end up back here no matter what.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If it was possible for Death to have any expression, it would have a wicked grin plastered across its face. As it was, Daniel had no clue how he was sensing the emotions emanating from the reaper. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cLet\u2019s see. You spent your time playing fantasy games, right? One of the worlds under my domain is a part of the System. You might not be as strong as initially, but it will allow you to grow beyond everyone\u2019s expectations. Plus, you\u2019ll have way more fun there.\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Death swept its scythe across the air, tearing a hole in reality. There, a night sky filled with majestic dragons of countless colours captivated his attention.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At this moment, Death was like a cunning devil, its words dripped in honey. Even if there was a catch involved, what could Daniel do about it? Die? He hadn\u2019t lived enough in his first life to reject a second one. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWell? What\u2019s your choice?\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For a moment, silence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI agree.\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A simple exchange of words sealed his fate, the contract going up in black flames. A weight settled in his soul, a sense of power like no other. The coldness of limbo was slowly fading away, though emotions were still hard to come by. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWhy, that was so much easier than last time. But you\u2019re not a proper soul reaper yet. Let me help you,\u201d it said, twisting its hand. For a moment, his soul was as large as a galaxy, stars but mere specs in his presence.<br></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI\u2019ve placed a Gate of Reincarnation in your soul, simply shepherd the souls through there. I can\u2019t speak of anything else, as even I don\u2019t know what the System can do, but, trust me, you\u2019ll be a certified soul reaper in no time,\u201d Death spoke, lifting its scythe high above Daniel\u2019s head. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cSee ya later! And trust me, we will be meeting again,\u201d he said, and before Daniel could interject, the scythe sheared through his soul, agony filled every inch in just a moment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cAGH!\u201d A short grunt of pain escaped his lungs, his eyes practically popping out of his head. His hands went to clutch his heart, which was when the sensations all around him overwhelmed his mind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The smell of fresh grass and the sound of bugs buzzing nearly knocked him off his feet, and even the slightest ray of light tore through his retinas like staring at the sun. He tasted the sweet air in front of him, for once in his life breathing unpolluted air. His hands reached his face, feeling flesh touch flesh. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Despite the sensory overload, power filled his entire body. His legs no longer buckled under his weight, and the pervasive sense of sluggishness stopped bothering him. For the first time in years, Daniel\u2019s body was full of energy, something he could only reminisce about.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But, before he could test his newfound strength or process any of his memories, he heard a horrible crash coming from behind him. Whirling around, he beheld the most terrifying creature he had ever seen. Standing over several broken trees was a deer that was as tall as him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That was where the familiarity ended - the deer\u2019s hide was of lustrous silver, and all across its body sprouted wicked sharp crystals. They twisted and curled and came in various shapes, all of them crimson-red. The antlers on its head were made of the same stuff, with a single minor difference. Encased in its antlers was a separate set of eyes, constantly moving around. Its real eyes were bloodshot, focused on cleaving through another tree. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWhat the...\u201d he whispered, his hands trembling. His knees threatened to buckle under him, and if they did, he could bid farewell to his second life. It was abundantly clear that this was a creature straight from a fantasy game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Very carefully, he stepped back from the creature, hiding behind the nearest tree. Another loud crash echoed through the forest, but Daniel didn\u2019t dare to peek at the scene of carnage. \u201cThink, think,\u201d he murmured, failing to keep panic from his voice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cOh. Please work,\u201d an idea shot through his head like lightning. If he was in a game-like world, then surely this had to be included. \u201cStatus.\u201d </span></p>\n<p><strong>Name: Daniel Willow </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Class: Soul Reaper (Legendary) </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Level: 1</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Job: None</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Stats:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>STR:10 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>VIT:8 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>DEX:10 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>INT:12 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>WIS:12 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>LUK:8 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Available points: 0 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gate of Reincarnation (Legendary)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Reaper\u2019s Eyes (Rare)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Soul Scythe (Common)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A pitch-black box appeared in front of him, the letters glowing with golden light. It took Daniel just a moment to parse through the information, not sparing a second to marvel at the legendary tags. As he was reading the first skill, a separate box appeared to his right, providing even more information.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Gate of Reincarnation (Legendary)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The founding stone of an underworld, the gate is the basis of a separate space existing in the reaper\u2019s soul. The gate allows the wielder to reincarnate harvested stray souls, receiving Soul Points in return, which are used to construct a self-sufficient underworld. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Reaper\u2019s Eyes (Rare)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Eyes that can pierce through the mortal coil and peer beyond. Allows the wielder to see a creature\u2019s soul.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Soul Scythe (Common)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A phantasmal scythe conjured from mana. Cleaves through a designated point near the wielder. </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The first two looked intriguing, but common sense dictated they wouldn\u2019t be too useful in combat. Soul Scythe, however, showed promise. Unfortunately, he had no clue how to cast it, or if it would even kill the deer. Better not risk certain death on a piece of text. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Holding his breath, he very carefully shambled backwards, making sure to not step on any fallen leaves. Daniel made it five steps backwards before he saw an antler pop into view, the crystallised eye locking onto him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cFuck.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Throwing all caution to the wind, Daniel began to bolt, running faster than he had ever run. Chancing a look behind him, he saw a searing bolt of fire streak from the monster\u2019s antlers. His mind screamed at him to dodge. His body followed soon after. The bolt soared past him, only stopping when it encountered a nearby tree. The aftermath was disastrous - the tree practically evaporated from the sheer force. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">His surroundings blurred past him, adrenaline rushing through his veins. At this moment, the forest itself was his enemy. It threatened to trip him if he didn\u2019t fully concentrate on it. Glimpses of other beasts showed they were just as scared as Daniel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The rushing of wind through his ears did nothing to muffle the horrid cries of the monster behind him. It was rapidly gaining ground! He couldn\u2019t outrun the creature. He had to do something. Spotting an area with relatively flat ground, Daniel urged his legs to move faster. It was a miracle he hadn\u2019t stumbled already, having slept in the same bed for years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Reaching the clearing, Daniel looked back only to see the maddened eyes of a predator. Its breath was distorting the air, and all four eyes locked on Daniel\u2019s body. At this point, he could only hope his intuition was correct. Taking in a deep breath, he pointed at the neck of the monstrosity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cSoul Scythe,\u201d he chanted, praying to every god that it worked. The next moment, his stomach lurched, exhaustion hitting him like a hammer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Above the deer\u2019s head, a chilling blue mist gathered in the shape of a scythe, lacking any real detail. An alabaster white hand swung the phantasmal scythe downwards, disregarding everything in its way. Had the deer\u2019s head been there, it would have been instantly decapitated, but by the time it took the spell to form, the deer had already shot past it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Daniel\u2019s heart dropped. Cold sweat began to run down his back. He hadn\u2019t come to terms with his second life yet, not to mention a second time dying. His steps faltered for a beat, and that was enough time for the monster to catch up. Desperately, Daniel threw himself to the side, but the deer\u2019s antlers were unwavering. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Pain unlike any before pulsed through his left shoulder, flesh being burned by the second. He screamed in agony, every thought occupied with bearing the pain. His mind flickered between lucidity and unconsciousness, desperately fighting to hold on. The monster pinned him to a tree, bringing Daniel face to face with it. It bared its sharp teeth, a mocking gaze roaming across his body, saliva dripping from its mouth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Daniel didn\u2019t have enough strength to point. Instead, he channelled all of his agony into a burning rage, looking at the deer\u2019s neck. \u201cS-Soul Scythe.\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This time, the scythe didn\u2019t miss. The monster\u2019s gloating expression turned to befuddlement as its head flew through the air, bringing Daniel along with it. As they both impacted the ground, the antlers dug even deeper into his body. Letting out another cry of pain, he wanted nothing more than for the horrific agony to stop. <br></span></p>\n<p><strong>Medium soul harvested</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A black box flickered into view in front of him followed by a sensation that was overshadowed by constant pain. Moments later, another box popped into existence. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Soul Reaper 1 ---&gt; Soul Reaper 2 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Available points: 7 </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cS-Status,\u201d he whispered, coughing up blood. With his last conscious thoughts, he focused on VIT, putting every available point there. </span></p>\n<p><strong>VIT 8 ---&gt; VIT 15</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Then, he passed out.</span></p>\n            </div>",

He'd fall off a cliff, save a beautiful woman from a mugging, and breathe his last breath watching her cry over him, or in a freak hang-gliding accident that his insurance would vigorously contest as a disguised suicide attempt.</p>\n<p>Instead, it was just the normal, garden-variety cancer. He didn't smoke and never worked a day in a factory filled with toxic fumes. So, when he asked his doctor why cancer had chosen him, his doctor shrugged.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t always a reason. Some people just draw the short straw.\u201d</p>\n<p>Maybe it was the fact that he disliked going to the doctor. It didn't seem like he had to. He was young and in shape. Why waste money on doctor visits when it could go toward bills at the end of the month?</p>\n<p>By the time the doctors caught the cancer, there wasn\u2019t much point in treatment. The official recommendation was for him to go home and enjoy the few months he had left.</p>\n<p>Matt had a small life insurance policy, courtesy of his job. Turns out, some life insurance policies pay out early when a person's fate is sure enough. It wasn\u2019t much, but it was enough to survive on, given the overall timeline of things. With the money, Matt took short weekend trips to places he had always wanted to go. That got old quickly. Eventually, he needed a hobby to pass the time, and he chose gardening.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t try to be a good gardener. He hoed the ever-loving hell out of his backyard until every inch was tilled and fertilized. After scattering a random assortment of seeds and putting up a \u201cCaution: Uncontrolled cellular growth\u201d sign, he limited himself to watering and watching, waiting for the plant that would win the battle royale.</p>\n<p>When weeds popped up, he\u2019d absolutely nuke them with herbicide. At first, he was cautious about the dosages, but then stopped after he realized you couldn\u2019t get cancer twice, and it wouldn\u2019t matter much even if he did.</p>\n<p>By the time his body finally gave out, his backyard looked like a bizarre, artificial jungle built by a madman. And that\u2019s pretty much what it was.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cOh shit. Ooooh, shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Matt was having a difficult time coping with the afterlife. He wasn\u2019t particularly religious, so he didn\u2019t have much in the way of specific expectations. What he hadn\u2019t expected was to find himself sitting at a very fancy table in a well-adorned meeting room. What he had expected even less was to look over and find a talking, thinking delivery truck in the chair across the table from him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, fuck. Fuckedty fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t coping well. The truck was both full-sized and moving towards him, yet somehow stationary and perfectly sized for its average desk chair. If he had a normal, human brain, Matt suspected it would have burned out trying to work out the implications of the visual contradiction. That it didn\u2019t was one of the benefits of the afterlife, he supposed.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, no. No, no, no.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSir, if you would calm do\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy is it\u2026 why? No. I don\u2019t want this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSir, if you would just listen for a moment\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAhhhhh! Ahhhh!\u201d</p>\n<p>It took a while to come to terms with things. When he finally got there, he had questions.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, this might be rude, but\u2026 why are you a truck?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not a truck. I\u2019m an automated system soul migration counselor and assistant, meant to ease your journey to your next plane of existence. I can take any form.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOK, fine, but\u2026 why a truck? Why not another human? An angel?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy appearance is calibrated to the average user expectation. Soul migrations from your planet are rare, and it was deemed time to recalibrate the model. My research indicated that this was, or rather, this is a common representation of a soul migration device in the type of fiction popular in your demographic.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was a while before Matt could talk without laughing. The truck-system had attempted to be nice, and Matt didn\u2019t want to hurt its feelings. Instead of settling on an angel or the grim reaper, the system in front of Matt had decided that the best image was a persistent image of <em>getting trucked.</em></p>\n<p>Eventually, Matt was calm enough to get to the serious business of being dead. He might have imagined it, but the system assistant gave him just the faintest sense of being relieved.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you are saying you are going to send me to \u2018the next plane\u2019. That\u2019s\u2026 heaven? Somewhere worse?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot in that sense, no. Some souls don\u2019t survive the process of dying. They're purely lost and are replaced. Other, rarer souls go to a simulated environment. Their memories are wiped, and they are put in a life relatively ideal for them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s me?\u201d A simulated paradise shouldn\u2019t have sounded terrible, but somehow it did. \u201cNo offense, but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m cut out for fake simulated heaven.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. That\u2019s not where you are headed. Remember, I\u2019m a <em>truck.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean\u2026 Oh, shit\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>A small trumpet noise played from across the room, near the wall. A few handfuls of confetti materialized from nowhere, and a small pop unfurled a poster reading, \u201cCongratulations on your Isekai!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is <em>hilariously</em> underwhelming, system.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was reluctant to shock you again after seeing your reaction to my truck-avatar.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFair.\u201d</p>\n<p>The system waved its wheel-arm and a small desktop pamphlet holder materialized. Matt grabbed a pamphlet, \u201cGaia! The Garden Planet! Come as yourself, and GROW!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am limited to sending souls to realms with some level of conflict that they can solve. Within those confines, I try my best to assign my souls to worlds that match their interests, thematically. Frankly, a LOT of your interests are satisfied just by being transmigrated. More than you\u2019d think. It\u2019s a little offputting, honestly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another gesture brought up a floating video screen showing Matt\u2019s frantic, chaotic gardening of the past few months.</p>\n<p>\u201cBesides the media you consume, this stood out to me as significant. You were dying and you chose to garden. Every plane has plenty to do, and plenty of options on how to live your life. But you like plants, and all the historic information on Gaia indicates it\u2019s all about plants. It seems like a good match.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if I wanted something different? Something more intense?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are a few other options. The one that matches most closely with what you are speaking of is the demon death battleground, Ra\u2019Zor. Also known as the realm of one thousand bleedings.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cActually, on second thought, Gaia seems fine\u2026. Do people really ever choose that second one?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAdolescents, mainly. And to the realm\u2019s credit, I have heard they have very good soups.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo when do I go?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSoon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow soon? Do I have time to tour the administrative portions of heave\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>It was then that Matt noticed that he was plummeting, fast, toward a red-black planet.</p>\n<p>Fast in this case was very fast. The planet went from marble to beach ball to giant, all-encompassing behemoth in the blink of an eye. He didn\u2019t know much about soul migrations, but he was really hoping that he would slow down before contact. Not just for his own sake, either, but also because he suspected his impact might have an unpleasant dinosaur-extinction-level effect on the local fauna.</p>\n<p>Just then, he slowed to a stop, and a small blue screen materialized out of nowhere in front of him. Exactly what he was hoping for.<br><br><strong>*ding!*</strong></p>\n<div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 98.6813%\">Welcome to Gaia, traveling soul. In a moment, you will be transported down to your new home: a lush, beautiful paradise of glorious plants and astounding animal life. But we are not without our troubles. The system will grant you power, and your guardian will meet you upon arrival to give you guidance. The fate of a planet hangs on your actions. Good luck!</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<p>Matt had just enough time to confirm that system screens were dismissed by swiping before shooting off again toward the planet. He felt his body become more and more material over the next few seconds, just in time for him to slam, hard, into the surface of the planet.</p>\n<p>Despite the visual evidence, Matt was shielded from any harm instead of spreading out like bloody jelly on the surface of the new world. Coughing in a cloud of red dust, Matt slowly stood up. Besides the immediate impact zone, the hit didn\u2019t seem strong enough to damage the local environment much; If Matt wanted to cause a mass extinction event, he\u2019d have to find another way.</p>\n<p>The system had at least clothed him at some point during his descent. He was spared from nakedness by both simple sandals and a roughly spun garment. It reminded Matt of a longer, permanently closed tank top. He waited for the dust to clear, eager to catch his first glimpse of the planet.</p>\n<p>As the dust finally dissipated, Matt winced. It took a moment for his eyes to adjust to the harsh brightness of the two suns hanging in the sky.</p>\n<p>Looking down, Matt caught his first glimpse of the red and black dirt expanse that was his new planet. The terrifying, open, deadness of it arced off into an empty, barren infinity. The plants were impressive in the sense that they had managed to not exist at all. So far, Gaia was a garden in the same way that doughnuts were cardio.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck. He sent me to the demon death planet. System, did you send me to the demon death planet?\u201d</p>\n<p>No answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cSystem screen on! System screen\u2026go!\u201d Matt tried several combinations before screaming, \u201cSystem! Help!\u201d Somehow, that worked. With a combination of hand flailing and consistent repetition of the word 'system', Matt learned how to summon various screens. Leaving aside his status for now, he brought up the map screen. It was a square mini-map, covered in gray, with only a single splotch of red. Beneath the map was the button \u201cLocation Details\u201d, which he mentally tapped.</p>\n<div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 98.6813%\">\n<p>Planet: Gaia (Dead)</p>\n<p>Continent: Sarthia (Unpopulated, Lost)</p>\n<p>Province: Sarthia Capitol District (Defeated)</p>\n<p>City: Ruins of Sarthia Kingship (Defeated)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<p>Matt looked around for the supposed ruins and found nothing but flat, burned dirt. He called up the window for system queries. Supposedly, the system could handle basic questions about local history and environments.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are the ruins?\u201d</p>\n<div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 98.8243%\">\u201cRuins\u201d is a generalized system term referring to the area where a city or named structure once stood.

It didn\u2019t matter if he couldn\u2019t tell what plants and water could be consumed if there was nothing around to consume. He was on a very limited clock, and the system wasn\u2019t being particularly helpful.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, about that guardian you mentioned\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Matt was immediately inundated with a series of dings</p>\n<div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 98.8243%\">\n<p>Searching for guardian\u2026</p>\n<p>Search error detected.

        "chapter_content": "<div class=\"chapter-inner chapter-content\">\n                <p>Lotus Shen waded through the thronging crowd, paying no heed to the leery eyes that followed her. The pungent mixture of petrol, metal, and smoke assailed her senses and roiled against the acid in her gullet. Subconsciously she lifted her balaclava higher up the ridge of her nose, though this did little to mask the miasma of fellow racers, nor to calm her own jangling nerves.</p>\n<p><em>Stop worrying so much, </em>she tried to tell herself, <em>this isn\u2019t your first rodeo.</em></p>\n<p>Indeed it was a mystery to herself why the lead-up to these races still managed to throw her out of sorts. Coming into tonight\u2019s event, she was on a seven-race win streak, good enough to clear six figures in winnings and to stock enough goodwill with Uncle Dave to keep him off her case for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>She <em>knew</em> she was good at this, even though she never planned to be. She was so good, in fact, that soon enough she\u2019d have raked in enough ill-gotten cash to never have to race again. So, why the nerves?</p>\n<p>Lotus pushed her way to the edge of the crowd and met the final set of leery eyes that greeted her there. The leeriest pair, as per usual, belonged to Mezcal Mike, who leaned casually against the seat of his Kawasaki Ninja 650R, the corner of his pierced lips curled into a knowing sneer.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was beginning to hope you might not show up,\u201d he flashed a wide grin, showing off the gold teeth that had replaced most of his upper incisors. How much of a stereotype could this guy be? \u201cBut you\u2019re looking mighty fine as always.\u201d As he said this, his gaze dropped to the machine by Lotus\u2019s side: a jet-black Suzuki Hayabusa GSX1300R, a bona fide force to be reckoned with on the streets\u2014and the only thing of value Lotus\u2019s father had left behind. Then Mezcal Mike quickly shifted his eyes back onto Lotus and widened his grin, \u201cOh, and you too, girl.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop being a creep and get this thing started up already,\u201d Lotus snapped, then pulled out a crumpled wad of cash from the inside of her jacket. \u201cEight grand. That enough?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa, whoa, slow your roll, baby,\u201d Mike chuckled. \u201cBuy-in tonight is set at four thousand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFour?\u201d Lotus frowned. \u201cBut we\u2019re racing on the Inner Ring Road. Look at the crowd that\u2019s gathered. Surely, the stakes ought to match the hype.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, the crowd will get their money\u2019s worth, don\u2019t you worry about that. They\u2019re here for <em>you</em>, don\u2019t you see? Besides, do you realize how much I had to hustle just to fill the grid tonight? Your name carries weight now, baby girl. Raise the stakes any higher and you\u2019ll only scare away the marks.\u201d</p>\n<p>The furrow in Lotus\u2019s brow deepened. The news soured her already tetchy mood. Half the buy-in meant half the winnings, and that was under the generous assumption that Mezcal Mike would be scrupulous with his accounting. And half the winnings meant her and Echo\u2019s road to financial independence would stretch just that much farther. In his spiel, Mezcal Mike had also hit upon another touchy subject: that of Lotus\u2019s rising reputation among the local populace, which meant that fair competition would be increasingly difficult to come by (unless she moved and started over somewhere she\u2019d be a complete unknown). She had no desire for a lengthy career in street racing, but if she weren\u2019t more judicious with her participation, she soon might not have any choice in the matter.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, Lotus,\u201d Mezcal Mike still nursed a pasted-on grin, \u201cyou can\u2019t back out now. Think of your adoring fans. Think of\u2026 think of that boy of yours waiting at home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Leave my brother out of this!</em>\u201d Lotus snarled, and so expressive was her anger that Mike clammed up immediately, his grin fading along with his wisecracks. She looked around at the run-down gas station that doubled as the racers\u2019 illicit meeting place, and felt her own impatience mirrored in the eyes that had turned toward her outburst. Race or not, she had to make her decision quickly, before their little gathering drew unwanted attention.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d she finally said, \u201cbut if I win, you boost my cut of the winnings. 60% of the total pot, and that\u2019s final.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mezcal Mike widened his eyes in alarm, \u201cNow hold on just a\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not negotiating, Mike. Agree to sixty right now, or I walk away. You said it yourself. The high-rollers are here for me. <em>I\u2019m </em>the show.\u201d</p>\n<p>The hustler was silent for a while, his pierced lips still parted but no longer forming anything resembling a smile. Then he let out a sound that was halfway between a grunt and a squeal and nodded, wordless. Lotus allowed herself a thin smile for the first time tonight, then promptly wheeled her Hayabusa away from Mike and toward the starting grid.</p>\n<p>The smell of gasoline and burning metal intensified as Lotus settled into her designated position. A few of the helmeted faces beside her directed muffled yells toward her, no doubt expressing unfailingly polite observations on just what they thought about a young woman competing in their midst. Lotus ignored them all and directed her gaze forward\u2014only ever forward.</p>\n<p>Though she wouldn\u2019t admit it even to herself, this was the moment she relished above all else. Here at the starting grid, shoulder to shoulder with other riders that she\u2019d soon leave in the dust, nerves didn\u2019t subside but rather crystallized into something more visceral and systemic, something almost otherworldly. Here, her blood ran cold, but this had the effect to reinvigorate rather than freeze. Here, the rumbling metallic beast she straddled was no longer a painful reminder of the life that had been taken from her and her brother, but rather an unbridled promise of the victory within her reach. Astride a motorcycle about to scream into the night, Lotus Shen felt more powerful than she could otherwise dream of.</p>\n<p>The signal at the intersection of Spence and McBride switched to green. All but in unison save for a few inexperienced stragglers, thirty-odd engines roared thirstily and threw their metallic frames into the buffeting wind. The runway cut sharply onto a steep winding on-ramp, and already a cacophony of clashing metal, skidding tires, and screams of dismay erupted behind Lotus as the lesser (and unluckier) riders spun out. For them, the night was already over, their $4,000 going up in flames, only to be replaced by repair and medical bills.</p>\n<p>Nearer the front of the pack, Lotus let her instincts take over, twisting in and out of slipstream after slipstream until she found herself side by side with a blue Yamaha YZF-R1. Just as the on-ramp joined onto the Inner Ring Road proper, she opened the throttle in full while a whole half of her body leaned precariously over the side of the bike. She felt the bump and scrape of asphalt against her kneepad, she felt the Hayabusa rise above the constraints of gravity and friction, and she felt her adversary\u2019s hopes die out as she surged into the lead.</p>\n<p>Just like that, the hardest part was over. The race was almost as good as won. Lotus zoomed through the beltway that cut through the city in a rough circle, navigating its curves and straightaways with casual ease. Every corner was an opportunity to express her skill, and every sprint was a chance for the Hayabusa to let loose its irrepressible power. Both represented avenues to extend her lead.</p>\n<p>By the time she approached the end of the full circle, she and her machine were so far ahead of the pack that theirs were the only sounds she could hear: the whirr and whine of the Hayabusa\u2019s four-stroke engine, as well as the steady rush of her own breathing. Nerves had well and truly dissipated now, for in this briefest and densest of moments, all her worries, fears, and anger had merged into a singular purpose. Money, Mezcal Mike, Uncle Dave, Echo\u2014and her parents\u2014all that and more would resurface once the race was over, but for now, she needed only to ride. Eyes forward\u2014only ever forward. The only thing that remained was the night and the open road.</p>\n<p>The first sign that something might be amiss was the scent in the air. She was used to the cloud of gasoline that accompanied any racing event, but this was different\u2014something unexpected, something <em>deadly</em>.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, as she rounded the corner that took her onto the homestretch, she spied a wall of dark smoke illuminated by streetlights. She gripped the brake, acting again on instinct, and slowed even more urgently when she saw the source of the burning. A massive truck with a cylindrical container\u2014a fuel tanker\u2014lay on its side, taking up nearly the entire width of the road in both directions. Plumes of smoke rose along the length of the tanker as bright orange sparks flew from the charred mess of its exposed chassis. The asphalt underneath was slick and dark. Lotus didn\u2019t need an uninterrupted high school education to understand that she needed to get far away, as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>But the trance of the race wasn\u2019t so easy to break. Lotus\u2019s first instinct was to accelerate again, ride <em>toward</em> the disaster and through to the other side, where Mezcal Mike hopefully wouldn\u2019t let a little thing like an overturned tanker on the course detract from upholding his end of the deal. Her fingers even wrapped against the throttle and began to turn before she noticed something else that gave her pause.</p>\n<p>Amidst the smoking wreckage was a figure, a fellow rider but one that was decked out in a simple leather jacket and jeans instead of a riding suit\u2014a <em>tourist</em>, Mezcal Mike might\u2019ve dubbed in derision. And this figure now turned toward her and waved with both arms flung wide, clearly trying to get her attention. From what Lotus could make out, the stranger didn\u2019t look to be under physical duress. And where was his bike? Why hadn\u2019t he gotten the hell out of dodge?</p>\n<p>A roaring engine zoomed past with a rush of air\u2014needlessly close\u2014as the blue Yamaha she\u2019d overtaken on the first on-ramp regained the lead. Its rider barely slowed as they weaved past the smoking wreckage and out of sight. This was quickly followed by a second bike, then a third. One of them even had the audacity to honk as they passed. Lotus felt a pang of rising panic, far removed from the flow state she\u2019d been in just seconds ago. This couldn\u2019t be how her winning streak would come to an end. She wouldn\u2019t allow it. She tucked herself low and turned the throttle, ready to start the chase anew.</p>\n<p>But then the figure next to the wreckage came into view again, and this time she could do nothing else but to skid to a complete stop. For the figure had now removed his helmet to fix Lotus with his gaze, wide eyes framed by a sweat-drenched face that she knew well.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop, Lotus!\u201d the figure yelled, breathless. His voice was a rolling baritone that still managed to surprise Lotus, even though it\u2019d been at least a year since it changed. \u201cI need your help!\u201d</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t supposed to be here. In fact, he should never have known that <em>she\u2019d </em>be here\u2014should never have known anything about her street racing. And even as a behemoth of metal and gas spewed black smoke and poured its innards onto the road right beside her, all Lotus could focus on was this accident of mutual discovery. For the figure that had flagged her down and caused her to give up on her $4000 was none other than the very reason she was doing any of this in the first place\u2014her younger brother, the only family she had left in the world.</p>\n<p>\u201cEcho?\u201d Lotus breathed, voice weak with perplexity. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p>\n            </div>",

        "chapter_content": "<div class=\"chapter-inner chapter-content\">\n                <p style=\"text-align: left\">From one moment to the next, I was somewhere else. There was no in-between frame, no flash of light, or expository dialogue to explain my change in circumstance. I didn\u2019t get a reason for the complete ruination of my life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">No, I got to fall on my ass in the middle of a forest clearing in-between eye blinks.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">At the very least, I wasn\u2019t naked at the time, being out and about and wearing regular worn clothes and worn shoes. I couldn\u2019t even imagine how much more confused I would have been if I had been transported in the middle of the night or in the dead of sleep, instead.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">I like to consider myself a fairly level-headed person most of the time, but this went beyond the norm. Bearing my new, extraordinary circumstances in mind, however, I\u2019m willing to forgive myself for being stunned enough to not realize I wasn\u2019t alone. To be fair, I don\u2019t think they had noticed me yet either.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Maybe fifteen feet away from where I was sitting, there was a scene out of a historical period piece happening. What appeared to be a train of perhaps thirty wagons with covered roofs had created a circle around a bonfire. Inside that circle, I could see a mass of people in rough-spun clothing going about their day, setting up a camp, and doing chores. On the outskirts of the camp, however, the most visible people would have to be what could only be guards. They didn\u2019t look to be very attentive, as it appeared that the guards of this camp were the restless teenagers given a spear and busy work.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">At the same time that I noticed the nearest \u2018guard\u2019, he noticed me. With a shout, the nearest one attracted the attention of the others and started towards me. Scrambling to my feet, I tried to make myself look non-threatening to the pissed-off-looking teen by raising my hands and speaking calmly.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">\u201cHey, uh, I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on, but I\u2019m not looking for any troub-\u201d I started. Before I could finish my sentence, the teenager had gotten close enough to me that he could ready his spear, point it at me, and start shouting.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">The problem was, I didn\u2019t understand a word of what he was saying. Frankly, I couldn\u2019t even identify the language that he was speaking.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">That did not have great implications.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">The shouting of the guard had not only drawn the attention of the other guards, which were starting to stream over to me, but it appeared to have drawn attention from the camp itself. Appearing at the edge of the camp was an older man in more functional-looking armor than the leather gambesons over simple woolen clothing that the teenagers had. This guy was wearing actual chainmail, a steel helmet, leather vambraces, and carrying a sheathed sword at his waist and a shield over his back.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Making his way over to us, the older man barked a command at the other guards and made a dismissive motion at them. As they started to return to their posts, what I could only conclude was their overseer had reached the guard still pointing a spear at me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Taking his eyes off me to speak to the older man, the teenager started jabbering away at the older man excitedly. As he started to speak, the overseer turned a suspicious glance my way based on whatever the guard was telling him. However, whatever he was being told was clearly not making him very happy. Before the teenager was even finished speaking, the older man snapped something at him that made him fall quiet.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Taking a closer look at me, the older man suddenly began to frown harder than he had been. For some reason, he just kept awkwardly looking at me, as if something would change if he stared long enough. Several minutes passed in this way before the man turned and spoke to the teenager again, suspiciously keeping one eye on me. Suddenly, the teenager was staring intently at me as well, but whatever they were trying to do was clearly not working. The teenager squinted suspiciously before he turned to the older man and said something to him.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">The older man was quiet for a few seconds before glancing at me again. Suddenly, in a startlingly fast movement, the overseer grabbed a wooden truncheon he\u2019d hidden in his belt behind his sword and swung at my head with blinding speed.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">I was only able to recognize what was happening as the club neared my temple. Before I could react, from one moment to the next, I was unconscious.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">I couldn\u2019t tell how long I'd been out of it. For all I knew, I had been out for days.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">As I slowly started to come to, I was barely cognizant of my surroundings. Frankly, I felt like total shit. I had a massive, pounding headache and a ringing in my ears like I had never experienced in my life. I hadn\u2019t even opened my eyes yet and wasn\u2019t even sure I was able to considering how groggy I was feeling. I barely retained enough presence of mind to wonder if this was what a concussion felt like.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">What had actually awoken me, however, was the feeling of a wet rag being gently dabbed on my face.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Slowly cracking one eye open, I tried to look at whoever was touching me. I couldn\u2019t manage it, however, as my eye wasn\u2019t able to focus properly. All I was able to see was a vaguely human shape gently wiping my face with a rag.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">And then I passed out again.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">When I woke up for a second time, I felt fine. Which, frankly, startled me awake very easily once I realized that fact.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Jerking my head up from where it had been resting on my chest and opening my eyes, I was actually able to take in my surroundings this time.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">It was nighttime when I woke up and I must have been in the back of one of those wagons I had noticed earlier. I was sitting in the back of one of them with my arms tied behind my back to a post built into the wall of the wagon. Furthermore, I had a rag tied around my mouth in order to prevent me from speaking. Glancing around, I guessed this must have been one of the supply wagons considering the number of food products I could see sitting in crates around me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">At the back of the wagon, the opening had been left uncovered to a view of the outside. This didn\u2019t help me very much however, the way the wagon was situated meant that all I had was a view of the forest not very far away. Looking at the forest, I could guess that this caravan had moved from the place I had arrived in, however. From what little I could see; it looked like a much smaller clearing.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">It must have been very late when I woke up because I didn\u2019t hear any activity from the camp where I was. I could see a faint amount of firelight from what remained of the bonfire, but other than the faraway crackling of logs and the call of faraway insects, that was all I could hear.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Taking stock of myself, I felt surprisingly fine. Despite being hit in the head extremely hard, by my standards at least, I don\u2019t think I even had a scratch to show for it. The only aches I could complain about were the ache in my arms from being tied, and the ache in my ass from sitting on wood in one place for who knows how long.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Relaxing now that I didn\u2019t seem to be in immediate danger, I let my head fall back against the wagon wall with a thunk.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">What the fuck was happening to me, I thought to myself. I had to wonder if anything that was happening to me was even real. Was this all a dream? Did I get hit by a car, and this was a coma? Recollecting the series of events that had brought me to this point, I stifled a hysterical laugh from exploding out of me. First, I get teleported somewhere else completely out of the blue instantaneously. Second, I get threatened with a spear by a skinny teenager. Third, I get knocked the hell out by some medieval LARPer and then tied up in the back of an honest-to-God wagon.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">I couldn\u2019t comprehend how this was happening, and I didn\u2019t want to.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">I must have spent the next hour staring blankly at the other side of the wagon before something knocked me out of it. Raising my head, I was able to put my finger on what had unsettled me. The insects had stopped, and the forest had gone silent.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Something must have caught my eye in my peripheral vision because I looked out to my right at the forest through the wagon's back.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">There was movement in the trees.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Freezing up in immediate terror like a mouse before a cat, I tried to look more closely at what was happening at the tree line. As I watched, several indistinct man-like forms started to slink out of the darkness and into the clearing. It was hard to focus on them, however, as the forms of these creatures were blurred somehow. It reminded me deeply of a movie I had seen as a child about an alien stalking an army platoon.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Whoever or whatever was getting closer to the caravan was extremely cautious, even with their ability to become semi-translucent. Squinting, I was able to make out over a dozen forms slowly crawling along the ground, making their way towards the caravan.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">For a moment I considered trying to call out to try and wake the caravan or even alert any potential guards that had missed the coming danger. But, for whatever reason these paranoid idiots had put a gag on me. Beyond that, I didn\u2019t even have much room to thrash about to try and make some noise, being bound to the wall the way I was.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">That decision seemed like it would come back to bite them in the ass shortly.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Before long, the forms that were creeping across the clearing had passed beyond the limited sight allowed by the portal of the wagon. I tensed up, dreading what was surely going to happen soon. These people, this caravan was undoubtedly in real danger right now. Nobody that had any kind of pure intentions would be trying to approach a camp so stealthily. I made the decision to try and hunker down closer to the wagon floor and behind the crate of vegetables I had been looking over the top of.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">For long minutes, I didn\u2019t hear anything but the stifled sound of my own breathing. Then, a stifled scream, as if it had been cut short somehow.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">After that, the camp erupted in a riot of noise, too difficult to parse all at once.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">The sound of banging and shouting, as if someone was pounding on a metal object.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">The high-pitched scream of a woman, stifled.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">The cry of the horses, frightened by the noise.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">The cacophony of steel upon steel.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Considering everything that was no doubt happening in the camp, the attack didn\u2019t take overly long. Ten, perhaps fifteen minutes after the ambush had occurred, the furor died down. Outside the wagon, I could hear a harsh, guttural voice in that same language I didn\u2019t understand earlier. There was an intonation to one of these voices, louder than the others that I couldn\u2019t place, as if every word they spoke had an undertone.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">It didn\u2019t in any way sound human.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">They were yelling and screaming at other people, hitting them as well from the fleshy noises I could hear. I couldn\u2019t really tell what they were doing, but most of the voices seemed to be congregating near the bonfire.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">After a few moments, one of the harsh voices yelled loudly, causing most of the moans and crying to quiet down, if not stop. Then, what seemed to be a long explanation from one that same voice that had yelled.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">This seemed to spark something in the humans, as one masculine voice spoke up, angry and frightened. This caused the harsher voices to erupt in even harsher laughter.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Then, a slicing noise. And two separate thuds.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">More screams and cries from the gathered humans, before harsh yelling and screaming caused them to cease.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">After that, things moved quickly. I heard struggling as the surviving humans were separated out and moved around the camp. I heard people rummaging about through the items left around the camp. I heard the wagons and horses being readied to move out.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">I heard the heavy sound of boots moving to the back of the wagon I was trapped in.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">With a growling laugh, the figure at the wagon opening tossed something into the wagon that landed in front of me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">It was a woman. Hogtied.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Our eyes met.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">She was younger than me perhaps, but only by a few years. Brown hair, brown eyes, tanned skin, and the build of a woman that worked for a living. She could have been anyone back home, the veritable Jane Everywoman.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Right now, she was covered in mud, blood, and tears.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">After a moment, the woman seemed to dismiss me. Turning on her side away from me as best as she could, I could hear her start to sob silently into the gag that they had fitted her with. Much like my own.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">As the wagon started to move out, no doubt being directed by one of the raiders, the end oriented itself towards the bonfire I had seen and heard. I risked a quick peek over the top of the crate I was cowering behind.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Fading in the distance, I could see a vision of horror. The raiders had callously tossed over a dozen human bodies on top of the bonfire. Men, women, those teenage guards, and even a few children were visible.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Burning.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Crackling.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">An indescribable smell of burning human meat reached me, even at this distance.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Slumping back down to hide behind the crate once more, I helplessly stared at the wall over top of the still sobbing woman.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Captured twice since I\u2019d gotten here, wherever here was.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">What the hell was going to happen to me now?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n            </div>",

        "chapter_content": "<div class=\"chapter-inner chapter-content\">\n                <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Zareth was glad that he had chosen to wear his shawl and headscarf when he was sent out to meet his next client. Even after having lived in this world for more than two decades, Zareth still found it difficult at times to adjust to Tal\u2019Qamar\u2019s scorching desert sun. Life would have been so much more pleasant had he been reborn in a lovely tropical paradise instead.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Zareth\u2019s eyes darted in vigilance as he walked toward the city\u2019s wealth district at a steady pace. Clever [Thieves] had seamlessly stolen his possessions using their Skills too many times over the years for him to feel comfortable. However, it wasn\u2019t only criminals that he had to worry about. In particular, Zareth made sure to keep an eye out for the ornate white robes worn by the clergy from the temple of Suhail. They wouldn\u2019t hesitate to harass him if given the chance, but he was relieved to see that they were nowhere in sight.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I guess the sand-worshiping bastards aren\u2019t going to ruin my day for once,</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Zareth thought with a smirk. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With his mood lifted, Zareth hummed a tune as he passed through the market district of Tal\u2019Qamar and kept an eye on his surroundings. The city was as bustling as ever, with traders from all over the region passing through one of the largest oasis cities in the harsh Qahtani Desert. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Along the streets, vibrant stalls lined with colorful awnings provided shade to the merchants and customers. Zareth could smell the aroma of exotic spices, while the sounds of haggling and conversations filled his ear. Various goods from textiles and pottery to expensive enchanted trinkets and jewelry were on display, showcasing the city\u2019s status as a regional trading hub.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As much as he might hate the heat, Zareth knew that there were many places out there much worse than Tal\u2019Qamar. The city was quite prosperous thanks to its location and was also unusually tolerant toward people of different species. That last part was particularly helpful given that humans were rather uncommon in this part of the world.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Zareth found his attention being drawn to a lizardkin selling some foreign fruits and decided to indulge himself by trying a few. They were a tad expensive given the distance involved, meaning that the merchant needed to use a high-level Skill to prevent spoilage, but what was the point of living if you didn\u2019t treat yourself every once in a while? Besides, business had been surprisingly good recently.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The merchant obviously tried to scam him for as high of a price as possible, but Zareth was a native of Tal\u2019Qamar. He was well acquainted with the tricks and tactics used by people trying to scam him out of his money.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThis is a Sabellian Peach, human! Not only is it delicious but there are even some who\u2019ve received a point in Spirit after eating them,\u201d the lizardkin boasted as he tried to justify his exorbitant prices. \u201cFifteen silver for one of these is practically a steal!\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThen why is nobody buying them?\u201d Zareth asked bluntly, raising an eyebrow. Fifteen silver was more than most skilled laborers made in a week. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude, but it\u2019s clear that you tried to sell these to one of the nobles before the deal fell through. You won\u2019t find many people in this part of the city willing to pay fifteen silver for a fruit. How about five silver instead?\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The lizardkin hissed angrily at him, but Zareth knew that he was right and that the merchant didn\u2019t have much leverage. Sure enough, they eventually agreed on a price and the lizardkin reluctantly handed over the fruit for seven silver coins.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With the transaction complete, he took a bite of the fruit as he continued along his way. It was quite delicious and tasted something like a blend of an apple and a mango with a hint of something exotic Zareth couldn\u2019t quite place. As he ate the fruit, Zareth decided to pull on that strange presence in his mind connecting him to his Status. He wanted to see if his Spirit had actually risen after ingesting the fruit.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Name: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Zareth</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Class: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cultist Level 18</span></p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Stats:</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Active Skills:</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Passive Skills:</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Strength: 16</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Corrode Flesh</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Magic Perception</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Vitality: 18</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Deaden Nerves</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Flesh Perception</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Agility: 16</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Flesh Manipulation</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cerebon\u2019s Boon</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Spirit: 24</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Minor Purify Flesh</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Aesthetic Intuition</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Willpower: 22</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ritual of Offering</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Veterinary Knowledge</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Control: 22</span></p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nope. Spirit is still the same,</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Zareth thought as he turned his attention away from his Status. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He wasn\u2019t particularly disappointed because it was obvious from the start that the merchant was just trying to get a better price for his wares. There probably was someone who improved their Spirit by eating the fruit, but the stat must have already been on the verge of an increase. Stats weren\u2019t so easily raised.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Before he made it to the wealthy district, Zareth made sure to dispose of the fruit core and make himself presentable. His business relied almost entirely on word of mouth and aristocrats would be much less likely to hire him if he looked like a common street rat. Zareth made his way over to an ogre merchant who was selling mirrors and handed the muscular nine-foot-tall humanoid a copper coin in exchange for the use of one.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As he adjusted his headscarf and shawl, he gave himself a quick once over. Zareth looked much the same as every other human native to the Qahtani desert, with dark skin, gray eyes, and a wiry build gained from years of living in a harsh environment. He was a tad shorter than he was in his past life, standing at just under six feet tall.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Unlike most humans in Tal\u2019Qaram, Zareth\u2019s skin was smooth and unblemished to an unnatural degree and he hid two ears filled with piercings under dark, shoulder-length hair. Both his unnatural skin and his many piercings were consequences of his service to Cerebon, which Zareth did his best to avoid advertising. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Satisfied with his inspection, he continued on his way toward his client\u2019s residence. As he neared the center of the city where its wealthier citizens lived, Zareth felt a pang of jealousy at the opulence that he could see. The buildings were constructed from polished stone and gleaming marble, unlike more modest clay and adobe buildings in the outer districts. Many of the residences even had gardens with exotic magical plants, expensive fountains, or other luxurious displays meant to show their wealth and power.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Personally, Zareth felt that the upper class of Tal\u2019Qamar being comfortable enough to flaunt their wealth said enough about their power. Not only that, but there were even </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">fewer</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> guards here than in the bazaar. Although, that probably shouldn't be surprising when you lived in a world where wealth and combat prowess were often linked, through either higher levels or enchanted items.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Zareth noticed the crowd becoming significantly less diverse the further he traveled into the wealthier portion of Tal\u2019Qamar. It wasn\u2019t long before he became the only human walking along a street with nothing but lizardkin and the occasional snake-like naga. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thankfully, Zareth had begun to cultivate something of a reputation since he began his business, so there were fewer people looking at him strangely than when he first started. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It wasn't long before he arrived at his destination, one of the larger manors in the district. A grand entrance flanked by two intricate carved stone pillars led to a courtyard filled with lush greenery and a beautiful fountain out of place in a desert city. The manor itself was a sprawling, multi-tiered structure with elegantly arched windows and balconies that offered a view of the well-manicured gardens below.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As Zareth approached the entrance, his [Magical Perception]  allowed him to sense the potent wards surrounding the building, the outermost layer designed to alert the inhabitants of any guests. A lizardkin guard with dark-red scales and finely crafted armor stood watch at the entrance. As Zareth approached, the guard raised a hand and gestured for him to halt.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cState your business, human,\u201d the guard demanded, his voice cold and authoritative.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Zareth offered them a polite smile before he replied. \u201cGreetings. My name is Zareth, and I\u2019m here to see Lady Yssir. I believe she\u2019s expecting me for an appointment?\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The guard stiffened and eyed him with caution, clearly recognizing his name. \u201cYou\u2019re the [Cultist]? Don\u2019t look like much. You ain\u2019t one of those crazy System hating freaks, are you?\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Zareth hid his annoyance and chuckled softly before shaking his head. \u201cNot at all, sir. I\u2019m just a humble servant of Cerebon, God of Flesh and Transformation. I have no issues with the System. Besides, I\u2019m sure a respectable woman like Lady Yssir wouldn\u2019t be associating with such extremists, no?\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Reminded that Zareth was there on the invitation of his superior, the guard hesitated for a moment before finally nodding. \u201cFine, follow me.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Zareth trailed behind the guard as they passed through the manor\u2019s expansive courtyard and entered the main building. The interior was just as lavish as the exterior with opulent furnishing and expensive pieces of art adorning the walls. The guard, unbothered by the many servants going about their business, guided Zareth through the foyer to a set of grand double doors and announced their presence.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cLady Yssir, your guest has arrived,\u201d the guard called out.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Moments later, the double doors slowly opened to reveal a spacious chamber where Lady Yssir, an elegant naga dressed in fine silks, awaited. Her upper body was that of a beautiful human woman with light skin while her lower half was a long snake tail with green scales that she had laying along the couch she was reclining on. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cYou are punctual, human. I\u2019m glad to see that you are not foolish enough to waste my time,\u201d said Lady Yssir, her voice cold as she set aside the book that she had been reading and studied Zareth with a mix of curiosity and disdain. \u201cI\u2019ve heard much about your\u2026 talents. I expect you to live up to your reputation. Gharan, you may leave us.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The guard bowed and left the room, closing the door behind him. Lady Yssir gestured to a nearby chair, and Zareth obediently took a seat with a polite smile on his face. He\u2019d long since gotten used to the condescending attitudes of Tal\u2019Qamar\u2019s upper class. It had annoyed him at first, but so long as he got paid good money and didn\u2019t need to go back to being a penniless vagrant, he could endure a little bit of arrogance.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThank you for having me, Lady Yssir,\u201d Zareth said respectfully. \u201cI understand that you require my assistance with a few cosmetic alterations that you would like to have done. Please share the details with me so that I can provide the best possible service.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lady Yssir continued to study him for a moment longer before finally speaking. \u201cThere are a few important social events that I\u2019ll soon need to attend. I\u2019ve heard good things from Lady Tiraz about your ability to improve the luster of skin and scales in a way more natural than common elixirs. I will naturally pay you well for your work.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Getting [Aesthetic Intuition] was the best decision I\u2019ve ever made,</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Zareth thought with glee. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Not only was he given the chance to do work that would contribute to raising his Class level, but he got the chance to make good money while doing so. This was far better than hiding in some forsaken corner of the world and making fleshy abominations or ritualistically sacrificing isolated travelers as the Grimoire of Cerebon recommended.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI understand, Lady Yssir. Just to be clear, you wish any alterations I make to appear natural, yes? Could I convince you to allow a few minor variations in shade in regard to the color of your scales?\u201d asked Zareth, hoping that she would agree. Cerebon seemed to prefer bodily changes that were more dramatic in nature, and it would contribute more to leveling up his Class. \u201cI think it would look quite striking and enhance your natural beauty even further.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lady Yssir raised an eyebrow at Zareth\u2019s blatant flattery but seemed to be considering his proposal. After a few moments of silence, she nodded. \u201cVery well. I will trust your judgment, but remember that I expect these changes to be subtle and tasteful. I am not some newly wealthy merchant\u2019s daughter eager to flaunt herself in a garish manner.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cOf course. If you have no other specifications, then we can begin straight away,\u201d Zareth said eagerly. He could feel that he was rather close to increasing his level and was hopeful that he would be able to do so in this session. \u201cIt would be best if I begin with your scales and move on from there.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lady Yssir agreed, but not before warning him about the consequences if he did anything </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">improper </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">while working on her. Given that he wasn\u2019t suicidal, Zareth quickly reassured her of his professionalism. Moments later, the naga woman placed the end of her serpentine tail in his lap and he began preparing to begin the procedure. Zareth gently laid his hand on her scales and used [Flesh Perception] to get a thorough understanding of her body composition. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Aside from being slightly more muscular than he would have expected, Zareth didn\u2019t find anything unusual so he activated [Flesh Manipulation] and got to work. It was perhaps a few minutes after he had started that Lady Yssir broke the silence. \u201cYou are quite a bit better than I had expected, human. Have you been doing this for long?\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI acquired the Skills necessary for this about a year ago, Lady Yssir. That's when I began,\u201d said Zareth, indulging the woman\u2019s curiosity as he smoothed the scales beneath his hands and infused them with a subtle sheen. \u201cBefore that, I focused more on tending to minor wounds for those who didn\u2019t wish to spend the coin on someone with a specialized healing Class.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cHmm, I see,\u201d Lady Yssir mused, her voice betraying a hint of intrigue. \u201cI must admit, I was skeptical when I heard about your services. In a city like Tal\u2019Qamar, most [Cultists] are not quite so open about their Classes, especially not ones who serve gods as\u2026 unique as your own. I have never heard of Cerebon. How did you come to serve such a deity?\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Zareth continued his work as he considered his response. Nothing about his Class or business was explicitly illegal, but his situation was delicate enough that he needed to be cautious with the information he shared. \u201cI received instruction on how to earn the [Cultist] Class when I was younger from a traveler. He told me about Cerebon and the Skills he offered, so I felt like it was a path worth pursuing.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">From Zareth\u2019s perspective, one of the strangest things about this world was how transactional the relationship between gods and their worshippers could become. There were certainly many who followed their chosen deity out of genuine faith or devotion, but it was also common for people to simply pursue the benefits. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A traveler had somehow noticed Zareth\u2019s unusual maturity and intelligence, so decided he would make a good worshiper for his god. Cerebon\u2019s Skills and Boon had offered him the chance to be something more than a Thief or a Street Rat, so the decision had been an easy one.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lady Yssir seemed to accept his explanation, nodding thoughtfully. \u201cInteresting. I\u2019m surprised that the Conclave of Sarqalim has allowed you to operate unmolested.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I wish. My life would be much easier if I didn\u2019t have to pay those bastards bribes constantly,</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Zareth thought bitterly. The Conclave of Sarqalim was an organization formed of the most popular religious groups in the region and held an outsized amount of power in the city. Tal\u2019Qamar was ostensibly ruled by a powerful [Merchant Lord], but the Conclave had been gradually accumulating influence for as long as Zareth could remember. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThe Conclave has seen fit to ignore me so long as I don\u2019t preach against the System or seek any followers for Cerebon,\u201d said Zareth, choosing to omit the part about the bribes. \u201cAlthough, that varies between different clergies. The temple of Suhail has been particularly hostile toward me when they have the chance.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lady Yssir scoffed disdainfully before responding. \u201cTypical. The Conclave has long since forgotten that it is not their place to enforce this city\u2019s laws. If the [Merchant Lord] doesn\u2019t rein them in soon, then someone else will do it for her\u2026\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Zareth wasn\u2019t sure how to respond to that. It was surprising to him that she felt so comfortable voicing these opinions to a stranger, but the politics of Tal\u2019Qamar\u2019s upper class had always been opaque to outsiders. Instead of saying something that might get him in trouble, Zareth merely hummed noncommittally and continued his work.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lady Yssir didn\u2019t seem interested in continuing the conversation either, and he was allowed to focus entirely on the task at hand. It was only when Zareth was close to finishing the last of Lady Yssir\u2019s scales that something unexpected happened to break the silence.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Cultist has reached Level 19! Skill Point Gained!</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Zareth couldn\u2019t help but laugh and cheer with excitement, which Lady Yssir immediately reprimanded him for. \u201cWhat is so funny, human? I hired you to work, not act like a fool in my presence.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI apologize for the outburst, Lady Yssir,\u201d Zareth said quickly, trying to suppress his excitement. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to increase my Level for nearly a year now, and I just received the notification that I\u2019ve finally succeeded. It caught me a bit off-guard. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Contrary to his expectations, Lady Yssir\u2019s glare immediately softened considerably and she even offered him an approving smile. \u201cI see. Then I apologize for my words, human. There are few endeavors in this world more sacrosanct than personal growth and the acquisition of power. What Level have you achieved?\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Caught off guard by her sudden change in demeanor, Zareth hesitated for a moment before responding. There were some people who refused to share these kinds of details, but he wasn\u2019t important enough for it to really matter. \u201cI\u2019ve just reached Level 19, Lady Yssir. Thank you for your understanding.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThat is surprisingly high for someone of your age and background. If you are lucky, then you may be able to achieve a Class Evolution within the next few years,\u201d said Lady Yssir, somehow managing to sound both impressed and condescending at the same time. \u201cGo ahead and allocate your Skill Point, human. My people believe it is bad luck to delay such things, and I won\u2019t have you bringing ill fortune into my home.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">After giving Lady Yssir his thanks, Zareth pulled on the strange presence in his mind and moved to do just that. The first thing he did was examine the new Skills available to him. Zareth already knew that he intended to use his Skill Point to modify one of his already existing Skills, but it was already worth taking a look to see if he\u2019d met the requirements for something new.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Available Skills: </strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Active: </strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Minor Blessing of Cerebon - Temporarily bestows a lesser version of Cerebon\u2019s Boon to an individual regardless of their Devotion. Grants a slight increase to physical stats and regeneration. This path leads to further skills related to the bestowal of blessings and curses. +2 Spirit. +1 Willpower. +1 Control.</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Minor Siphon Vitality - Temporarily lowers the Vitality of the target while increasing your own. Effect increases over time. This path leads to further skills related to the manipulation of stats. +1 Spirit. +2 Willpower. +1 Control</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Create Lesser Flesh Golem - Allows for the creation of a small flesh golem, a simple construct with limited intelligence. Physical abilities vary with materials used for construction. This path leads to further skills related to the creation and modification of artificial beings. +1 Spirit. +1 Willpower. +2 Control</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Passive:</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Devotion Perception - Gain the intuitive ability to sense those who already feel devotion to a deity and those who would be open to your own. This path leads to further skills related to socialization and cult management.  +3 Spirit. +1 Willpower</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Malleable Flesh -  Increases the flexibility and elasticity of your own flesh, significantly enhancing the ability for one to modify themselves through Flesh Magic. This path leads to further skills related to personal augmentation. +1 Strength, +2 Vitality, +1 Agility.</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Zareth quickly went through his options and noted the only newly available Skill since his last Level increase, [Create Lesser Flesh Golem]. Much like the rest, it was a good Skill that wouldn\u2019t actually help him in his daily life. Zareth had no intention of fighting monsters or starting his own cult, so these Skills wouldn\u2019t be useful for more than their Stat increases.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Turning his attention to the Skills that he already possessed, Zareth looked to see which ones could be modified. Most of them didn\u2019t reach the Stat or Level requirements to be evolved, but there were a few exceptions. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One that allowed him to upgrade [Minor Purify Flesh] to [Purify Flesh], which would be better at purifying diseases than the previous rank of the Skill and also have a small effect on curses. Another upgraded [Flesh Perception] into [Flesh Intuition], which would give Zareth an intuitive understanding of how to best modify a person\u2019s body in terms of function. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[Flesh Intuition] coupled with the knowledge he\u2019d gained in his previous life as a veterinarian would be very useful. The System could compensate for a lot, but he\u2019d noticed that it was much easier to affect the parts of the body he understood the most. However, there was one option he had set his eyes on. Zareth turned his attention to the evolutions for his most important Skill.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Flesh Manipulation Evolution(s):</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Permanent Flesh Manipulation - Modify the target's flesh. Difficulty of modification increases with the complexity of the change and the difference from the target\u2019s original body. Changes can now be made permanent unless otherwise altered through Flesh Manipulation or a similar Skill. Permanent changes require relevant biomass. +2 Spirit.</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Precise Flesh Manipulation - Allows for more precise control over flesh manipulation, enabling more intricate and unique modifications. Changes are temporary. Changes do not require relevant biomass. +2 Spirit.</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">After taking a moment to recall what he had read in the Grimoire of Cerebon, Zareth ultimately decided on [Permanent Flesh Manipulation]. The ability to make lasting modifications would open up a whole new range of possibilities for his business, as there were many people who would pay for permanent changes to their bodies. [Precise Flesh Manipulation] was nice, but it didn\u2019t offer anything that he couldn\u2019t already accomplish with enough practice. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Plus, his clients shouldn\u2019t have much trouble acquiring the right biomass given that they were generally wealthy. With his decision made, Zareth allocated his Skill Point and felt a surge of power as the new ability to root in his mind and his Stats increased. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>[Flesh Manipulation] has evolved to [Permanent Flesh Manipulation]!</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThank you for your patience, Lady Yssir,\u201d Zareth said as he turned his attention back to the naga woman. \u201cI\u2019ve made my choice and I\u2019m ready to continue.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lady Yssir nodded, her expression unreadable. \u201cVery well. Proceed, human.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As soon as Zareth began working on the last of Lady Yssir\u2019s scales, he could immediately tell that his increased Spirit made his [Flesh Manipulation] slightly more efficient. After ensuring that he hadn\u2019t missed any scales and that they gleamed with newfound vibrancy, Zareth was about to ask Lady Yssir how she would like to handle the skin of her upper body when there was a knock on the door.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The same lizardkin guard from before, looking somewhat panicked, stepped into the room. \u201cMy Lady. I apologize for the interruption, but there has been an urgent development.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lady Yssir\u2019s expression changed from one of annoyance at the interruption to concern. \u201cVery well, Gharan. What is it?\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The guard hesitated for a moment, glancing at Zareth before he spoke. \u201cIt seems that the Conclave has been accused of assassinating Merchant Lord Raqasor. General Nasrith has taken control of the city and declared martial law. Soldiers are sweeping through the city and arresting members of the Conclave and those suspected of having ties to them.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What?!</span></em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While Zareth was sitting there in shock, Lady Yssir had already shot out of her seat with shocking speed and began making her way out of the door. \u201cOur business here is concluded, human. I suggest you return to your home as quickly as possible. Gharan! Give the [Cultist] his payment and meet me in the main hall with the rest of the guards once you return.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Gharan nodded and hurriedly gave Zareth a small pouch of coins that more than contained twice what he usually charged and began to usher him out of the manor. Much to Zareth\u2019s unease, he could hear the distant sound of commotion and shouting as they made their way through the opulent halls. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The guard didn\u2019t waste any time, practically shoving him out onto the street and heading back into the manor without another word.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What the hell is going on?! </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Zareth wondered as he stood there, clutching the pouch of coins tightly in his hand.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Within just a few minutes, he had gone from celebrating his increase in Level to hearing that the city was descending into chaos. Even in the wealthy district, Zareth could see panicked people rushing into their homes and raising their wards. The sound of shouting in the distance was growing closer by the second, and he suddenly realized that he needed to move quickly if he didn\u2019t want to be caught up in whatever was going on.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Being a [Cultist] wasn\u2019t illegal, but he had enough experience with Tal\u2019Qamar\u2019s guards that he knew to avoid catching their attention.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Zareth quickly started heading back to his home in the outer sections of the city as quickly as he could, sticking to the back alleys and quiet streets that he\u2019d grown so familiar with as a child. His heart pounded in his chest when he spotted soldiers wearing the emblem of Tal\u2019Qamar\u2019s military patrolling the streets or breaking into the houses of people he knew to be members of the Conclave.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Zareth kept his head down and continued on his way, praying that he wouldn\u2019t be targeted by any of the soldiers. He had known for a while that tensions between the Conclave and the city\u2019s government were growing, but he had never expected things to escalate to this level. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As Zareth reached the more familiar streets of his neighborhood he picked up the pace, desperate to reach the safety of his small and unassuming clay house. Unfortunately, he was greeted by a sight that made his blood run cold when he finally reached the street where he lived. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Exiting Zareth\u2019s home was an armored ogre wearing the emblem of Tal\u2019Qamar\u2019s military, and they had spotted him the moment he\u2019d turned the corner. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fuck! Why are they looking for me of all people? I don\u2019t have anything to do with the Conclave!</span></em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He briefly considered running, but not only did the nine-foot-tall ogre have much longer legs than he did, but he likely had a physical class like [Dune Skirmisher] or [Dervish Warrior]. His agility stat would at least be somewhere in the mid-twenties! It would be like someone who had never run in their life trying to outrun a professional athlete. The soldier must have realized this as well because he didn\u2019t seem to be in any rush as he strode over to Zareth. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cAre you the [Cultist] named Zareth?\u201d asked the ogre, his voice deep and rumbling. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI am,\u201d Zareth hesitantly confirmed. \u201cWhy are you looking for me? I don\u2019t have any affiliation with the Conclave.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cGeneral Nasrith has ordered all Tal\u2019Qamari citizens with religious Classes to be brought to the palace. The Conclave is to be dismantled and its temples barred from the city. All religious groups unaffiliated with the Conclave must formally swear fealty to Tal\u2019Qamar or be escorted out of the city.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Zareth\u2019s eyes widened in shock. \u201cBut I\u2019m just one person! I\u2019m not a member of a Cult.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. My orders were to bring you or send you out of the city, so that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do,\u201d said the soldier, uninterested in his excuse. \u201cWhich will it be, [Cultist]?\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Damn it.</span></em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Zareth took a deep breath to calm himself down and began thinking about his options. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He could fight or run, but he probably wouldn\u2019t last very long in either case. The soldier almost certainly had a Level advantage over him, and Zareth only had one Skill well suited for combat.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If Tal\u2019Qamar was about to go through a period of political turmoil as it seemed, then it would probably be safer for him to simply leave. Zareth had saved up enough coins and it wouldn\u2019t be impossible for him to continue his business in a different city. But\u2026 Tal\u2019Qamar was where he had lived the past two decades of his life. It wasn\u2019t a pleasant city, but Zareth was loath to allow himself to be driven out of it. Besides, there was also a chance that the soldier would suddenly chop Zareth\u2019s head off as soon as he refused to swear fealty.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As Zareth calmed down and thought about what his life would look like if he stayed in Tal\u2019Qamar, he suddenly realized something important.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is an opportunity\u2026</span></em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There were many aspects of his Class that Zareth couldn\u2019t exploit due to his lack of a Cult. If the Conclave was truly being thrown out of the city, then that opened up the opportunity for others to take their place. After all, the General was asking them to swear fealty rather than just throwing them all out, and there was a good reason why very few nations completely outlawed the worship of gods. The gods offered powerful Boons to those who worshiped them which would give any nation\u2019s citizens a sizable advantage. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If Zareth played his cards right, then this could change everything for him. The risks would be great, but the potential benefits were unimaginable. Cerebon would reward him very well if Zareth was able to convince people to worship the god. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He had long since given up becoming anything more than average, but it seemed that fate put this opportunity in front of him and Zareth would never be able to live with himself if he didn\u2019t take it.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With his decision made, Zareth turned to face the soldier and gave his answer. \u201cTake me to the palace.\u201d</span></p>\n            </div>",

        "chapter_content": "<div class=\"chapter-inner chapter-content\">\n                <p>The alarm blasted Cole awake at 5:30 am sharp, getting him up and ready for a morning full of activity. As usual he reached down to do his first stretch of the day, a swift pull of the plug out of the wall, silencing the electronic noise that had disturbed his dreams.</p>\n<p>Cole instantly went back to sleep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He woke up at the much more reasonable hour of 7:30, to the sound of rain pattering outside his window, just the right time for breakfast. He cooked some bacon and eggs on the stove and wolfed them down. While he wasn\u2019t fat, Cole definitely wasn\u2019t skinny. He liked to tell himself that he was just bulking.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Cole lived alone in his apartment. A few years earlier he\u2019d been injured in a construction accident while working as a labourer, and the compensation payout from that had been more than enough to allow him to retire at the age of 20. Cole now lived comfortably, not spending too much money, but just enough to allow him to enjoy the simple pleasures of life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He spent much of his time browsing his favourite webnovels and light novels online, as well as playing his favourite VRMMORPG, Vestria Online. In that world, he could be whatever he wanted, and he\u2019d invested just enough to become one of the strongest players in that world, able to hold his own in both PvP and Raid events.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In that world, he was a mage who had discovered the unique Instant Portal technique, and so was one of the strongest ever in combat, while many strong mages could use the teleportation and Spatial Gate techniques, his ability to instantly create portals across space and other dimensions meant that he was nigh unkillable. All other forms of instant transportation took up either time or huge amounts of resources. All it took for him was a mental picture of two points he wanted to bridge, and the gate was created. In fact, he had become so respected that he was even referred to as the Magus Supreme, aka, the strongest sorcerer in existence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He might not be the most crafty wizard, or have a huge library of spells to call upon. But no one could argue with Cole\u2019s sheer power. It was a chilling feeling to have someone who could relocate oceans in mere moments in your presence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After finishing his breakfast, Cole realised that he needed to head out to the shops to pick up his painkillers. The accident at work had left him with permanent nerve damage, which constantly flared along his limbs every time he moved them. The painkillers made it manageable, so that he could live a relatively normal life, rather than being paralysed by the pain. He felt sad for a minute, remembering all the things he would like to do in terms of exercise.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Oh well, I can\u2019t let it get me down</em>, thought Cole. He put on his warm puffer jacket, and prepared to leave his home to go down to the local chemist. He could feel the pain beginning to return, so he knew he needed to be quick. Normally he didn\u2019t let his supply run out before getting a refill, but the last few days had consisted of an intense, multi-stage Raid in Vestria Online.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Cole had the important role of quickly funneling in new troops and other players into the battlefield against the Storm King, the latest Raid boss that the Nexon company had added into the game. Luckily his hard work was not in vain. Everyone who had participated in the raid had earned a huge sum of gold for their efforts, while the guild who had contracted him for their help had given him a $100,000 USD bonus for helping them be the first guild to beat the Storm King. This meant that they could use the Storm King as a Titan level summon in the upcoming annual Guild War event. Often Titan-level summons were the deciding factor in the various battles that would be fought in events, however these types of summons could only be used once per year, so it was extremely important to be strategic.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Cole didn\u2019t really get involved with the Guild Wars, instead working as a private contractor to whoever offered him the most cash. With this method, he remained well-respected among all the players of Vestria Online, while also not being tied down to one specific group of people. Besides, Cole didn\u2019t like people. Not after the accident anyway.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He shoved his chin into the collar of his jacket, bracing against the chilling wind that was currently trying to push him back up the street. The cold was particularly intense today, stabbing into his body with a vicious monotony, which just kept reminding Cole of the pain that was building along his nerves. He quickened his pace, fighting the wind every step of the way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The cold reminded him of his greatest PvP duel, against the previous Magus Supreme of Vestria Online. That opponent had been a powerful Ice mage, who like Cole had his own unique skill. The skill, called Blizzard, allowed that man to change entire battlefields into a wintry wonderland that he would then have complete control over, able to appear anywhere. The cold of that skill would leech away at the flesh until it was completely frozen through. One strike, and his foes would shatter into a thousand pieces.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The shops where his chemist was located was just across the road now, and he stood at the traffic lights, impatiently hammering the button even though he knew that it wouldn\u2019t make them change any quicker. Cole rammed his chin back into his collar, staring at the pavement as he wriggled his toes in a vain effort to keep them warm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The sound of the lights changing in his favour rang through his ears, and Cole briskly strode onto the street, eager to reach his painkillers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Time froze.</p>\n<p>He saw it first, in the corner of his eye. The other crossing signal had gone off, not his.</p>\n<p>As he slowly turned his head to the left, the sound waves reached his eardrum. Two sounds distinctly stood out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>First, a piercing squeal, trying in vain to stop the onslaught of the doom that was hurtling towards him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Second, the horn, an almost comical sound that now seemed to spell only death, frantically warning him to get out of the way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He tried to move, but his body was determined to work against him. A jolt of pain, far worse than the ones he\u2019d had before wracked his body, paralysing everything but his neck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So as Cole was frozen, doomed to remain in the middle of the street, he could only turn his head towards the angel of death, while his body was ravaged by agony.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then the truck hit him, and Cole felt nothing at all.</p>\n            </div>",

But I suppose I am anything </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">but</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. I\u2019m about to turn 28 years old, a corporate accountant, single and </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">not</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> loving it. I don\u2019t look it, but I\u2019m into nerdy things like video games, comics, and fantasy stuff. Put it simply, eh\u2026I can pass for a regular person, but I\u2019m not. I haven\u2019t made all the right decisions. I settled for less in college and ended up with this desk job. Hell, I\u2019ve only even had one serious girlfriend\u2026Stephanie. And I messed that up too. It\u2019s been almost four years since the breakup. She told me my lack of ambition in life had put me back into the friend zone. I guess that\u2019s okay though. We still keep up. At least I\u2019m not as bad off as my best friend Wraith. Yeah, that\u2019s right, his name\u2019s Wraith. Well, it\u2019s actually Ernest Weathers, but he\u2019s always gone by Wraith. We\u2019ve been best friends since the 8th grade, and he used that nickname for </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">everything</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Screen names, video game characters, passwords, etc\u2026 Well, he\u2019s a pizza delivery guy at the ripe old age of 28. He\u2019s like me and looks like a normie, but he\u2019s just\u2026well\u2026a little more forward, personality wise, with his nerdiness.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As far as I go, nobility didn\u2019t exactly run in my family. My dad left me and my mom when I was just a baby. He sent us money every year to support us, but never called or visited. Turns out, he inherited an estate in England that he didn\u2019t even know about shortly after he married my mother. After he flew over to check it out, he sent her a letter that said, \u2018I\u2019m staying here, and I never want you to come to this place.\u2019 They say money changes people. In my experience that would be accurate. My mom always said that maybe I would end up inheriting the place someday too,but I never put much thought into it. I\u2019m really not sure I\u2019d even want anything from him after what he did to us. That is until the letter arrived\u2026</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It came from a man named Reginald Higgin\u2019s who claimed to be a business associate of my father. Apparently, the old man kicked the bucket. But it wasn\u2019t an invitation to the funeral. In fact, it didn\u2019t even mention a funeral. All it said was that he was coming to the US to meet with me and discuss my father\u2019s final wishes. I was to meet him at a local attorney\u2019s office for international affairs, since the estate was in another country.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It was late January, and when the day of the meeting came, I almost didn\u2019t even want to go, but I figured, what could it hurt? He gave us financial support when I was growing up after all. I suppose he\u2019s probably just dropping a pile of money on me and hoping that it would make up for a life of neglect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As I entered the office, the secretary summoned the Senior Attorney.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cHello, Mr. Noble I presume,\u201d said the somewhat hefty middle-aged man as he shook my hand, \u201cMy name's Mr. Ford. My office here will facilitate the transaction of any foreign assets you may acquire. Terribly sorry to hear about your loss.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cIt\u2019s alright, I didn\u2019t know him,\u201d I replied brazenly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mr. Ford\u2019s mouth was agape for a moment before he continued, \u201cRight. If you\u2019ll follow me, please\u2026\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He took me back to his office and brought me in. A tall man in a light gray suit was waiting. He had a gray bushy mustache with a part in his equally gray head of hair. And he had a western bow tie, you know, like the ones Colonel Sanders would wear.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cMr. Noble, this is Mr. Higgins,\u201d said Ford, \u201cHe had your fathers Power of Attorney and is Executor of your father\u2019s will.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cHow do you do?\u201d Higgins said, in an English accent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI\u2019m well,\u201d is all I could respond with.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cMr. Noble\u2026\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I cut Ford off before he could continue.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cEric is fine. I don\u2019t mind speaking formally, but I\u2019d prefer to hear my own first name.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cVery well\u2026Eric,\u201d he continued, \u201cMr. Higgins has informed me that your father left a video recording, specifically for you. And that only you and Mr. Higgins are to see it. This will take place before all the formal signing, but for my own legal protection, I require that you sign a waiver that permits me to exit the room during the video.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cFine, I\u2019ll sign it,\u201d I said as I took a pen and obliged Mr. Ford.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cExcellent. I\u2019ll be waiting in the lobby. You can come get me when you\u2019re finished.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The lawyer left the room and shut the door on his way out. Higgins and I stood across from each other in silence for a moment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cSo, you were a close associate of my fathers, huh?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThat\u2019s right. He was a colleague of sorts\u2026and a dear friend.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cYeah, well, glad you got to know him. I never did.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI understand your resentment, Master Noble. But I assure you, your father had you and your mother\u2019s best interest in mind.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cMy mother died a few years ago. Shame she went first. And what\u2019s with the \u2018Master Noble\u2019 bit?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He didn\u2019t reply. We stood there for another moment in silence before I took it upon myself to sit down adjacent from the television screen. Higgins took the cue to start the video and inserted a thumb drive into it and then sat in the chair beside me. He clicked the remote to turn on the video.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">On the screen was a man who was only vaguely familiar to me. It was an aged version of the man who appeared in some old pictures of me and my mother. He was a little buffer than I imagined. I recognized him as my father, but not as a dad\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cHello, son. I know that if you\u2019re viewing this, you probably don\u2019t have a very favorable view of me. I could spend countless hours explaining to you why I did what I did. But I know none of it, no matter how much you accepted as truth, would make up for my absence. So, I will not attempt to defend myself any further. However, unfortunately, during the time of this recording I am terminally ill and require a favor of you. Believe it or not but our family is more significant than you realize. My estate in England has been passed down for generations and long before the Mansion that was built on that land, it has been under our family\u2019s care. Though it carries a great burden. My biggest regret in life was having the hubris to think I could shield you from that burden. I\u2019m doing you a great disservice even now by leaving you ill prepared. The secret of our family lineage is so great that I can\u2019t take a chance by explaining it even now in this recording. So, I\u2019m giving you an ultimatum. Take the estate and all of the wealth that comes along with it, but also know that it comes at a price or take $100k cash right now, no questions asked. Higgins will leave and you will never see him again. The burden of our lineage will be taken off of you and you never even have to think of me again. I wish I had done things differently, but it is what it is. I know you\u2019ll make the right decision. It\u2019s in your blood. I will direct any questions you may have to Higgins. Goodbye Eric.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The video stopped. Higgins turned to me and said, \u201cWell, Master Noble?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I wasn\u2019t sure how to respond at first, so I thought for a moment. Finally, I replied, \u201cFirst off, what's with all this ominous talk about family burden? Second, I don\u2019t even know what the estate entails. How do I know the place isn\u2019t a dump and will cost me a bunch to fix it up? Is it even worth $100k on its own?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI assure you Master Noble, it is worth a substantial amount more. But we cannot discuss the details without Mr. Ford present. As far as your family burden, your father has forbidden me from answering anything about it unless you accept his ultimatum. Once you\u2019ve arrived at the property all shall be revealed. I can only say that the life you will assume once accepting will be a difficult one, but it will lead to glory.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cGlory? Difficult? The old man abandons me for a quarter of a century, then pops back up right before he croaks and says, \u2018here ya go, here\u2019s some difficulty for you\u2019. No thanks. I\u2019ll take the hundred grand and go back to my 9 to 5. As if </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">that's </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">not difficult enough.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Higgins gave a sad look for a moment and then responded, \u201cVery well\u2026I\u2019ll go fetch Mr.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ford and we\u2019ll finish up here.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He left the room as I stood there and held back tears from a lifetime of grudge holding against the man, we just watched on the video clip, knowing that there's no way I could tell him off personally. He was nothing to me. I knew him as well as I knew Higgins and Mr. Ford. Once the door shut on this office, I could hopefully shut out what memories of him I </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">did </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">have.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But then something happened. It was faint. Just a blip and only for a second. It was a memory from two years prior. The day Stephanie broke up with me. I was on the couch, playing a video game, and right before she slammed the door she said, \u201cYou have no ambition!\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">She was right. I made excuses for the easy way out. My lack of ambition held me back from everything good in life. Including her. I read books and played games about characters who sought glory, but I sought none of it. Higgins said the difficulty I\u2019d face by accepting the inheritance would lead me to glory. Maybe it was time I stopped letting my own laziness get in the way of the life I deserve. Perhaps the old man's best gift to me was opportunity rather than fortune. What\u2019s the worst it could be? Maybe the burden was just a bunch of hoity-toity prestigious events I\u2019d have to attend. Or juggling a bunch of bobblehead gold diggers. That\u2019s what my mom always thought my father did. Whatever it is, I\u2019m certain it's better than my accounting job. I could even win Stephanie back if I show I\u2019ve done something with my life!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Just then, the door opened and it was Higgins and Mr. Ford returning to finish the ordeal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cReady to wrap things up, son?\u201d Mr. Ford asked with a slight smile.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cAs a matter of fact, I am!\u201d I said confidently, seeming to startle the somber Mr. Higgins.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d I continued, \u201cI\u2019ll take my father\u2019s offer and accept his estate. I\u2019ll take on any challenges that it presents.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Higgins seemed elated, he closed his eyes, smiled from ear to ear, and clapped his hands together once and said, \u201cVery good sir! Your father would be proud. He was confident you\u2019d make the right decision.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><img src=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/GAMjFLWMQXFDgfwC9\" alt=\"\"></span></p>\n            </div>",

        "chapter_content": "<div class=\"chapter-inner chapter-content\">\n                <p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Leif fidgeted at the edge of the army camp atop a grassy hill not quite tall enough to be considered a mountain. He did so in the way he had been taught growing up, without any movements of his body or any nervousness reaching his face. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The kind of fidgeting only possible if you get beaten for appearing to not pay attention to lessons by the family tutor. The kind of fidgeting that involved mentally pushing and pulling small, mostly opaque grey rectangles with gold and red trimmings. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now you might feel concerned at the idea of boxes only visible within your mind's eye, doubly so if they had letters, numbers and words on them. These weren\u2019t hallucinations caused by schizophrenia but instead perfectly normal.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The young man moved and adjusted the system windows he had pulled up so they might block out the source of his worry. On another hill of similar size and shape were the enemy. The Enslaved Legion crawled over the almost mountain like the ant-like monsters their black carapace armour represented. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Leif had heard many soldiers doubt the invaders were human at all. They were, he knew, at least some of them. Though he suspected come morning he would be intimately familiar with just what kind of people they were.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cCaptain sir!\u201d Came a shout from behind along with running footsteps. Leif turned away from the enemy encampment, blinking the system out of his vision. As he did so sunlight glinted off his polished bronze breastplate, red and gold half cape fluttering in the wind. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cAt ease.\u201d Leif said, his tone not hinting at any lack of confidence. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">His second in command, a tall man from a northern border city squinted at the light and shuffled so he was parallel to Leif. He stood up straight and saluted, fist to heart. \u201cCaptain sir! Orders from above, squads are to muster and report to their captains... Sir.\u201d </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Leif nodded and followed the other man's wandering gaze, back to the legion encampment. At the small groups of black figures that were beginning to dig entrenched positions in the valley between both forces.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cAre we\u2026 Ya know. Actually gonna fight them? A real pitched battle?\u201d He asked. The two armies had been shadowing each other for the better part of a month, lightly skirmishing over position and resources so the question wasn\u2019t as strange as it might sound. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cYes, I\u2019m afraid so Heffnir. The generals and seers are planning something for tonight. At least that was the conclusion reached in the officers meeting earlier today.\u201d</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cFuck. Uh, I mean\u2026 How are the omens?\u201d </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThe omens are good, as to be expected I suppose. Shall we go?\u201d </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Heffnir nodded, the taller man followed briskly behind Leif as they wove through brightly coloured tents and below equally vibrant banners depicting noble heraldry. As the two departed dark clouds moved in front of the sun. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">===</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Rain fell in heavy sheets against the single file column of cloaked soldiers as they rounded the foot of the hill, the ground slick with muddy run-off. Above, fires raged from campfires and torches both, a reminder of warmth and comfort every man and woman taking part in the upcoming assault wouldn\u2019t experience until the battle was won.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Leif marched ahead of his squad, twelve men and women trudged through deep mud thoroughly worked by those that had been before them. Head down as rain soaked his hood, Leif pulsed his aura in short guiding bursts. The invisible echo of power rolling off his shoulders, moving as far back along the column as his level and attributes could allow, just enough to reach the next squad leader, hopefully anyway. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Visibility had plummeted as night had fallen and the rain had gone from light drizzle to a suffocating blanket of liquid. Leif could barely see five metres ahead, the backs of the soldiers he was trailing seeming to meld into the murky darkness. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Two more bursts, quick succession. None of his squad had aura skills but they could still feel the aura of those who did. An innate sense possessed by all living beings. Leif\u2019s [Noble] class, inherited from his father, had granted him a social aura when he had reached the second level. Intended to be used within courts and high society gatherings, the skill [Aura of Nobility] had fast tracked him into being an officer when the war broke out, though he supposed nepotism did most of the heavy lifting.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Unfortunately mud and rain don\u2019t care about one\u2019s birthright or caste. He cursed as part of the hillside slid out from under him making him slide over three metres and out of the single file marching formation.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Three short pulses followed by a fourth longer one. \u201cWait\u201d, the message said, conveying patience and apology. Using the light from the campsite above and the faint echoes of the advanced squad\u2019s aura pulses he re-orientated and continued onwards into the night. To battle.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">===</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Varan camp was alight with controlled flame and bustling with activity. This activity however wasn\u2019t from the usual bustle of soldiers. The kingdom's forces had slowly departed down the back of the hill to avoid detection from the Enslaved on the opposite side of the valley. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The activity was camp followers intentionally making themselves visible so scouts and lookouts with perception skills from the legion camp wouldn\u2019t see that business wasn\u2019t as usual. If all went well, the enemy wouldn\u2019t suspect anything until it was too late. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Legionnaires in dark carapace toiled in the valley below, creating makeshift earthwork fortifications, pits and low walls. This was standard for the legion, the two armies had shadowed one another like timid dancers around the narrow stretch of tamed land between rugged wilderness and a vast lake for a little over a month. During this time the Enslaved would entrench themselves to withstand harassment by the less orderly but more mobile Varan forces.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It was this consistent military doctrine the Varan army intended to take advantage of.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Flares of light magic intermittently lit up the night, fired in high arcs so as to not reveal the many snaking tendrils of soldiers from the assault force creeping forward. Light attuned mages within the Varan camp illuminating the legion\u2019s camp every five or so minutes, it was something the army did every night when the enemy was nearby. To scout, certainly. But the constant bright flashes were an indirect sort of attack, intended to prevent sleep and constantly distract. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A vibrant flash of green. Five minutes. Another, then yellow. \u201cAdvance.\u201d The message hidden within the colours relayed. And over a thousand soldiers obeyed. They would defeat the invaders here and now, or die trying.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">===</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Green, green, yellow. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Green, green, yellow. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Red, green, yellow. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Leif crouched in the mud, his squad fanned out behind him in a loose formation. He squinted into the night, trying to make out the legions earthen walls. When the red flare had been fired, mages with classes attuned to earth had begun creeping forward, their spells and skills evening out the final stretch of ground and filling in the newly dug moat.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The army didn\u2019t possess many [Terramancer]s, so those they did have would be burning through their energy as quickly as possible to ready the ground ahead. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Red, green, yellow. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another fifteen minutes passed, Leif could see his breath fogging in front of him as anticipation built, men and women fidgeted from where they stood, Leif could hear the muffled clanks of their armour as they shifted. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Soon, the blue flare should be any second\u2026</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Blue.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Attack. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With a hand on his sheathed sword Leif began channelling a skill into the blade. [Disciplined Strike] would build up energy until he struck out with his sword. With a flare of his aura he relayed his conviction and determination wordlessly to his squad and stepped forward. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To either side Leif could barely make out the outlines of other squads advancing, ghostly silhouettes in the night. It took over a minute of jogging before they encountered the returning earth mages, another thirty seconds and Leif's boots dug into a mound of piled soil, his footing secure and sure. He lunged upwards, the strength afforded from the [Might] attribute and the balance of [Alacrity] carrying him forward.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He reached the apex of the wall and saw two dark figures slumped against the bulwark\u2019s slight overhang. He fell onto the first, his knee impacting the armoured skull, the legionnaire\u2019s head snapping back from both the force of the blow but also surprise. Heffnir dropped next to the other, sword slipping into the gap between neck and carapaced breastplate.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Leif spun at the sounds of muffled yells and cries coming from all around. The alarm had been raised but was being drowned out by the rain. Five Enslaved stumbled out from under a cloth tarp, weapons drawn. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Leif had never stopped moving, he shoulder checked the first sending what he thought was a man tumbling, he drew his sword, hilt warm from the channelled skill, blade practically thrumming with power. With a single horizontal sweep two carapaced corpses fell back, bisected just above the hip. Their deaths instant, [Disciplined Strike] empowering his blade to cleanly sever through their spines. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A whistle blew, then another. Shrill sounds piercing the night as a proper alarm went out, alerting the legions main camp. But Leif couldn\u2019t focus on that, he parried a spear thrust and twisted his body into a counter, empowered by a skill from his [Guard] class; blade bit into organic armour and met the flesh beneath. The legionnaire screamed, a distinctly human sound.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It sent shivers down Leif\u2019s spine, to know these were people, victims of an enemy of humanity. He cut them down nonetheless.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">===</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The slaughter continued as the Varan forces seized the fortifications. Legionnaires fled into the night but over twice that number were butchered. Leif climbed back up the earthen wall but visibility was still terrible. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Where were the reinforcements?</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> They couldn\u2019t hold this position against a counter attack without them. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Green lit the night and Leif let out a sigh of relief, he turned and saw his men in the trenches below. Only one minor injury, no deaths. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">None yet. </span></em></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Varan spearmen began pouring over the wall and moving into a defensive formation with weapons presented towards where the enemy would approach. Orders were barked and ranks came together. Hundreds of eyes peered into the void, would the legion retaliate? Or would they abandon the valley and retreat? </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">An ear splitting screech split the night, puddles of rain water trembling from the sheer volume. Soldiers reeled and scrambled back. Fear rippled along the line as yells for calm went mostly ignored. Leif flared his aura to prevent panic and his squad stabilised. There was something reassuring about being enveloped by non hostile intent. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What the hells was that? </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He thought, mind racing.</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> A legion warform? A host?</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> The sound came again, louder, closer. Then chaos descended as dozens of dog sized ants surged out from the darkness. Axe-like mandibles flashed, hacking and slicing. Men screamed as they fell, insects swarmed onto shields and over heads, leaping and latching onto soldiers behind the first row. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Waves of terror, pain and panic washed over Leif, the emotions tangible due to his [Court Empath] skill, he shook his head and mentally pushed the skill\u2019s effect down. The raw emotions and intent faded into the background but the moment of distraction nearly cost him. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A monster leapt onto one of Leif\u2019s squad members but he thrust out a hand just in time. A half dome of grey force snapped into existence between the ant and soldier causing the attack to be deflected. Leif grunted at the sudden onset of strain from the skill but pushed forward.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Don\u2019t die. Please don\u2019t die. </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He prayed, but the night's events were outside his control. For every Varan soldier who fell another dropped from the wall and into the fight. For over a minute the brutal close quarters melee against the swarm continued.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Leif kicked one of the monsters off of the end of his blade and glanced around. Another screech split the night air, silencing the yells and groans of battle. But instead of a second swarm tall figures in gleaming carapace armour slick with water marched in ominous lockstep. The legion had rallied fast, </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">too fast. </span></em></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cCaptain Sir?\u201d Heffnir yelled. The unasked question hung in the air, Leif felt the attention of his squad slip from the advancing enemy and onto him. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We can\u2019t retreat. </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He thought. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A rout now would be catastrophic. </span></em></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cStand your ground!\u201d He roared, similar commands were bellowed up and down the reforming defensive line. Leif glanced over his shoulder and back to the glowing hilltop of the Varan camp. \u201cHold until-\u201d </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The night ignited in rainbow radiance as a barrage of magic so thick it was as though a wave of power had erupted from the hilltop. The thaumatic assault from well over two dozen mages soared through the valley, over the Varan soldiers before smashing down into the advancing legion. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But the enslaved weren\u2019t caught flat footed, no army so willing to sacrifice the lives of its own could be. As though compelled by madness the legionaries charged through the elemental destruction. Multicoloured flames wreathed their bodies and destructive sparks danced between spear tips. A hundred fell, immolated by magic. But it wasn\u2019t enough. As a second, significantly smaller barrage of power lit up the sky the two armies clashed. And death reigned. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">===</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Chaos. It was the only word able to describe the battle. The low visibility rendered all combatants near-sighted and commanders blinded to the greater movements of the fight. Fronts buckled and pushed but neither side could take advantage. Varan cavalry charged into enemy lines after a rolling wave of flames had baked the mud into hardened clay. They were never seen again.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Arrows fell in waves but from which side they originated couldn\u2019t be ascertained. Flashes of power would draw attention, the use of skills acting as a conductor of insanity. Corpses piled up and equal amounts of blood and water stained the ground. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At the two hour mark Leif received a ping informing him of a level up, though his system knew better than to flash a notification into his vision while he was fighting. He gasped in a lungful of air, repeated uses of [Recovery Breath] had limited effects but even a little vitality eased aches and lessened exhaustion. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Leif stumbled back, wiping blood from his left eye. He blinked blearily around, the sounds of battle had become distant and muffled. Moans and cries from the injured and dying came from nearby but he couldn\u2019t see their source. The downpour had long ago lessened but it had been replaced with the drifting miasma of mana essence. Visibility hadn\u2019t improved, if anything it had gotten worse.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Where are my men? </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He thought desperately. He hadn\u2019t seen most of them fall, Heffnir had pulled back after sustaining a critical leg wound and the rest had slowly vanished as the battle continued. If they had died or fled he had no idea. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He pulsed his aura, desperate to at least get into contact with one ally. During the fighting he and his squad had been pushed away from the now thoroughly ruined earthworks. But now he didn\u2019t know where he was. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The fires of both campsites were no longer in sight, whether they had been extinguished or the persistent haze was shrouding them Leif had no idea. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Footsteps from behind, hostile intent focused on him. A legionnaire missing an arm and with several arrows sticking from their armour rushed him. Half of a snapped spear was thrust at Leif\u2019s neck as he jerked backwards. Phantom echoes of the same attack materialised chaotically around the enslaved strike, the skill used was faint, its form barely coherent for more than a second, a sure sign of the user's exhaustion. <br></span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Anger, hatred and not a little desperation radiated off the enslaved as they attacked again and again in furiously wide motions. Leif stepped into an overhead swipe and planted his fist into the gut of his attacker. Air whooshed from the legionaries lungs before a horizontal slash enhanced by [Duellist's Focus] removed their head.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Leif sagged to the ground as the enslaved toppled back, torso becoming obscured by mist. Some sort of enhancing or empowering skill leaked from the corpse, mixing into the air. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">No wonder they were somehow moving with that injury. </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He thought numbly. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For several minutes Leif stayed still, propped up by his sword he listened to the ever quieting sounds of battle. A scream, and then nothing. Steel ringing against steel, and then silence. All was quiet. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Is it over? Is it finally done? </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thoughts ran through Leif\u2019s exhausted mind. How could he regroup with survivors? Would others come to find him? Had they even won? Or was the legion finishing off Varan stragglers? </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A riderless horse came screaming out of the fog, hooves kicking up mud as it rushed past. Leif made to grab for its reins but flinched back as the beast tripped, leg snapping under its own weight as it fell hard into the mud. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Not riderless. </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Two dog sized insects retracted their mandibles from where they had latched onto the now dead animal\u2019s flank. Their emotionless eyes fell onto Leif as the two monsters swivelled their bodies to face him. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">They rushed forward, legs skittering over the churned ground. Leif rolled to the side from his kneeling position. A Projected Shield snapped up around his back as he heard a crunch from a heavy impact. He spun up to his feet but screamed as mandibles latched around his forearm. Dropping his sword from the pain he stepped back and drew his dagger. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The short blade pierced the ant's eye, it went limp, but the mandibles stayed clamped firmly around his arm. The second monster, dazed from running head first into the now dissipated shield gathered itself before coming right at him.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Leif panicked, one arm was useless, likely broken, muscles and tendons severed by insectile blades. His sword lay submerged in mud and his dagger was stuck fast as he tried to yank it free from the insect\u2019s corpse. Pain lanced up his leg as the remaining ant bit through his boot and severed his achilles tendon. Leif fell hard on his side but impacting the ground was enough to let his dagger slip free.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Death rushed for his neck but he twisted, blocking the attack with the dead ant still latched onto his arm. The monster\u2019s body was dislodged from the blow, its vice grip on his forearm slackened. Leif kicked out with his one good leg and sent both carapaced forms tumbling.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He sucked in a breath but there was no relief from the pain. [Recovery Breath] was overused, the effect all but null. His physical attributes dropped, no longer enhanced from being in a combat stance. The ant came again, but the monster's fixation on his neck made dispatching it simple enough. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Leif\u2019s head fell back, a mix of blood and mud instantly soaking his short dark hair. His vision began to fade as blood loss took its toll. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I\u2019m going to die. </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He thought blankly, but there wasn\u2019t enough energy left for any particular emotion to take root. Fear had long ago fled in the face of exhausted acceptance. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Death came slowly, or slower than one might expect. A mix of increased vitality from attributes and the desperate intakes of healing breaths made the minutes crawl into an hour, then two. His consciousness flickered in and out. Each bout of darkness interrupted by a reflexive gasp and a spasm of pain. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At some point the mist began to burn away as the morning sun rose. In the few moments he could focus Leif saw the aftermath of battle stretching off into the distance. In the dawn light figures stalked the battlefield. Tall and slender with inhumanly twisted limbs, they stopped at corpses and the dying, hunched over as if feeding.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Growling came from his left but Leif was too weak to move. Something bit into his thigh but he could barely feel the pain. Two wolves with mangy coats and sunken features began to tug at his limp body. Feebly he pulsed his aura, but [Aura of Nobility] had no combat potential, it was simply a final, desperate attempt to survive. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">An inhuman hiss sent the two beasts whining and scampering away. Dark muttering in a language Leif wouldn\u2019t have recognised even if he were fully lucid drew closer. A figure, taller than any human and twice as thin stood over him. Glowing red eyes bore down from a face lacking any distinct features except for ash grey bark in the place of skin. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It spoke in a guttural hiss and knelt down. A crack formed on the creature's mask-like face in a mock imitation of a smile. An elongated, crooked finger pressed into Leif's chest, the sharpened claw-like end penetrated his battered armour as if it were heated butter and sunk into flesh. </span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Then something was pushed into him, rushing through his veins and pushing aside organs as it twisted and grew. Leif screamed as his soul was ripped apart.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em; text-align: center\"><strong>You have lost 5 levels in the [Fighter] class! -5 to all attributes!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em; text-align: center\"><strong>You have lost 5 levels in the [Guard] class! -5 to all attributes!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em; text-align: center\"><strong>Warning!

Good lad to be worrying about me like that though.<br><br>What am I doing? That is a very good question. Let\u2019s take stock shall we. Currently my head is killing me. Probably has to do with the blood flowing from somewhere that keeps getting in my eye. I\u2019m sure it will be fine. Not like it\u2019s going to matter if I lose my grip.<br><br>\u201cForget him, if he wants to die playing hero let him. They can burn together.\u201d <br><br>Grunt 2 that time. Off the Christmas list that one. <br><br>Burn? Nice of her to assume I\u2019m going to make it across this chasm to meet my toastie end on the other side. I\u2019ve been working under the assumption this pipe I\u2019m pulling myself along was going to give any second.<br><br> \u201cHelp!\u201d <br><br>Enter stage right, the reason I\u2019m sprinting my way towards the world\u2019s shortest reincarnation trophy. Weighing in at who knows at a height of 3ft nothing, Sobbing toddler 1. Okay fine not the best naming sense here but give me a break pretty sure I have a concussion. Little miss waterworks wails are not helping with that headache.<br><br>\u201cAnd safe.\u201d I exclaim as my feet make land on the crumbling floor on the side of this basement without a majestic staircase leading to what I can only presume is a much nicer place to be. A though given validation as I turn my head to catch a glimpse of Grunt 1 &amp; 2\u2019s boot heels ascending out of site.<br><br>I turn back wiping some of the red from my left brow so I can stare down at a girl looking at me with as much fear as she does the fire creeping up the walls from the inferno below. I know not the look she should be giving the selfless hero who has come to her aid. Probably has something to do with the giant red R on my own black attire. Guess that makes me Grunt 3.  <br><br>Reincarnation? I suppose I did just jump into it. Let me take you back about as long is it takes to make some terrible new life choices and tell you about my last and first day. <br><br>I, Simon Matthews, am not a good person. Shocking I know. In my defence, I was not given the best of starts. Orphaned from birth, no lovely dalmatian filled firehouse for me though. No, I got the prom night dumpster baby treatment. I can only assume my mother was at one hell of a party and planned to be right back, only to be waylaid by some primo spiked punch.<br><br>Fortunately a dumpster diving homeless man was kind enough to hand me over to the government. Pretty sure I was the wrong type of baby back ribs he was hoping to find. We can speedrun the rest of this first life. Foster homes in triplicate until I was 14 and figured I could probably do a better job of this whole raising a kid thing myself than the string of abusive drunks the government seems to think are the cream of the parental crop.<br><br>Crime kept a young belly fed and clothed. Picking pockets turned to picking locks, hoping fences to getting paid by them. I treated anyone around me like a threat and kept to myself. Got enough work to rent a place. Real roach hole but when your up all night it doesn\u2019t really matter where you crash out when the sun comes up. Eventually I grew up into a fine thug. Those fences putting a good word in with the worst of people. I became a bouncer for some of Glasgow\u2019s more seedy night clubs. I hurt who I was told to and robbed anyone I felt like I could get away with. Did my time without snitching anytime I got picked up by the boys in blue like a good little mutt.<br><br>Turns out that criminals aren\u2019t the most loyal sorts and when the boss\u2019s kid blames you for the cops seizing a stash house because you led them to it. Even though the boss knew you were alone with him tuning up some unlucky bloke. He will still take the opportunity to let his kid pin it on you to save face. Just not your face, no, your face will be ruined by a 9mm and a swim in the Clyde. <br><br>And then enter life number two while you\u2019re still reeling from the shock of a swift end to number one.<br><br>Wake up with a splitting headache, realise your pinned under some ceiling that one can only find in contempt for not doing its job and staying attached to the rest of the roof. The large slab pressing into your skull probably having something to do with the migraine.<br><br>\u201cWholly hellhound! How is he still alive.\u201d   <br><br>Grunt 1 again there, pulling the rocks off me keeping him firmly on that Christmas list. <br><br>\u201cCain get up that magmar escaped and is bringing this place down in its rage.\u201d Grunt 2 informed me.<br><br>\u201cMagmar?\u201d I said, dazed.<br><br>\u201cYeah, you forgot to lock the pok\u00e9 ball after we stole it. Get the kid we are leaving.\u201d<br><br>Just as I was getting to my feet was when the blast rocked the floor causing a large section to fly up then back down caving in on itself. My new coworkers and I were flung back against a staircase. Coworkers who I note are wearing outfits I saw for the first time when I played an old copy of Pok\u00e9mon red one of the older foster kids had left when they aged out.<br><br>Wondering if I died and hell is a cosplay styled escape room, I noticed air rushing down from the top of the staircase. Seemed like a good time to leave. The emerald haired woman seeming to agree as she says, \u201cToo late, forget the girl\u201d and starts for the exit.<br><br>That\u2019s when I hear her, she can\u2019t be more than 4 years old. Pushed up as small as possible on the other side of the room separated by the hole in the floor from us. Her tiny hands bound by some rope. Pink dress, brown hair both matted and dirty. From the blast or her previous treatment, I don\u2019t know.<br><br>Before I can stop to think I\u2019m leaping out over the edge and grabbing a pipe that must have run along the ceiling when it was intact. Its warm to the touch from the heat rising from below. The remaining brackets holding it to the roof snapping as I shuffle my way along as quickly as possible. I swear I could see something person shaped moving down below in that inferno.<br><br>I can hear you now asking\u2026 \u201cBut Simon you\u2019re a terrible person, why would you care.\u201d And I get it, trust me I do. However, I experienced firsthand the treatment children get when adults forget there supposed to protect kids first and foremost. I swore as bad as I got that\u2019s a line I wouldn\u2019t cross. I\u2019m an adult she\u2019s a kid in danger. Easy math. Which is good cause I was never very good at math.<br><br>Which of course brings us back to me standing above this rightfully terrified little girl doing my best impression of an umpire calling the play as my favourite pipe gives way to clatter down below. \u201cAnd safe!\u201d<br><br>\u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt me.\u201d The girl pleads as she somehow manages to shrink further into her corner.<br><br>\u201cI ain\u2019t going to hurt you lass. What\u2019s your name?\u201d<br><br>She looks at me funny, guessing Cain or grunt number 3 would have already known that. Unfortunately, the new body didn\u2019t come with a backup set of memories. <br><br>\u201cLily\u2026\u201d she manages to squeak out. <br><br>I get down on one knee to try and be less intimidating and try and reassure her the best I can.<br><br>\u201cLily, I am going to get you out of here okay. That\u2019s my only goal right now so please whatever I have done or said in the past, try and trust me. Okay?\u201d<br><br>She gives a slight nod and I take a breath as I turn to assess my new surroundings. Not much more to work with over here. No staircase or doors, there is a small alcove that I couldn\u2019t see from the other side of the room. <br><br>Moving towards it to get a better look I start talking mostly to keep Lily from focusing on the danger and how the floor on this side is getting smaller by the minute as more of it crumbles into the chasm as whatever is down below does it best impression of an erupting volcano.<br><br>\u201cI think I see a window over hear\u2026 Oh my god is that a snake!\u201d I practically scream. Okay so maybe not the best distraction for Lilly but can you blame me. As some of the smoke thins, I get a look at a snake more than twice the length of Lily is tall hiding in the alcove opposite Lillys corner. Now I get why she was bunched all the way up. <br><br>\u201cEkans\u201d it has the audacity to hiss at me in a questioning tone has it tilts it\u2019s head like a confused puppy.<br><br>Ekans the poison-type Pok\u00e9mon. Purple scales covering the majority of its body with the exception of a yellow ring just below the head. Yellow serpent eyes and rattle tail to boot.<br><br>\u201cTheres a good hallucination just move away from the alcove and let us terrible tasting humans through.\u201d To my delight the Ekans moved around the edge of the wall making a path for myself and Lilly to make it through. I picked her up with less protest than I was expecting and moved to check if we could get out the window. Unfortunately, it was too high up for me to get too but Lilly could with a boost. <br><br>It was one of those small, barred ones you see from the outside that give a bit of light to a basement room. I tried to get Lilly to squeeze through, but it was too tight for her, and we were fast running out of ground.<br><br>Make or break time. I steeled myself mentally and decided to go for the one in a billion chance and assume I had reincarnated into an actual Pok\u00e9mon world where snakes where smart enough to understand me without parsel tongue or some other magic. <br><br>\u201cHey, Ekans?\u201d the Pok\u00e9mon flinching back from me as I say its name and take a step towards it. Is it scared of me? Taking a closer look, I see its scales are in bad shape, it has lumps of old skin and its eyes are cloudy. Whoever it belongs too has clearly not been the best of trainers. \u201cNot going to hurt you their big guy, just need an assist.\u201d<br><br>I earn myself another head tilt. <br><br>\u201cI\u2019m going to get you out of here.\u201d I find myself repeating like I did with the much less dangerous Lilly. \u201cI\u2019m going to pick you up and boost you to that window, I need you to slip through the bars and around them.\u201d <br><br>\u201cEkansss\u201d I got a nod from him which was lovely and not at all making consider if I was fully insane from the concept that a snake can understand me. I gingerly tried to pick him up but had to resort to more aggressive huffing and puffing as I realised this was no light serpent. Ekans must have realised I was having issues as he slid up over my body himself using me like a ladder and got his head up through the bars and began to move away.<br><br>\u201cWait! Please, help me get the girl out at least.\u201d The Pok\u00e9mon stopped and curved around to look at me. Its cloudy eyes glaring with confusion like it didn\u2019t know where I had come from and hadn\u2019t treated me like its own personal climbing frame. \u201cPlease just her.\u201d I begged.<br><br>\u201cEk, Ek Ekans?\u201d Like I\u2019m meant to understand that.<br><br>To my delighted shock however he brought his body around the bars then stared down at me waiting. I said the first thing that came to mind, thinking back to those days getting high watching a 10-year-old travel his anime world. Me, jealous of his freedom as I waisted away in my apartment. <br><br>\u201cEkans, use wrap!\u201d<br><br>\u201cEeeeekaaanssss!\u201d the bars creaked under the strain of his muscles. Smash! The bars came loose falling to the floor as Ekans let out an exhausted \u201cKanss.\u201d <br><br>He lost his perch and fell back into the room with us. Stumbling to catch him left me flat on the floor with his weight on my chest. Pushing him off gently, I hoisted Lilly up and she crawled free of the room. Next was Ekans. He\u2019d earnt his own freedom. With my help he got free of the room once more. Both Pok\u00e9mon and child disappearing from my view. I heard the ground rumble and start to give way below me. Ekans Head appearing in the window trying to reach out to me.<br><br>\u201cNo, Ekans I won\u2019t fit. Get Lilly to safety.\u201d He stared at me again like I was the oddity not the living breathing video game sprite.<br>\u201cEkanss\u201d was his reply as he vanished from view again. Hopefully to not have a toddler sized snack.<br><br>The floor gave in on me then, can\u2019t be mad at it. Held out long enough to hopefully earn me some good karma points for life number 3.  Also, inanimate object and all. Only thing is I didn\u2019t land in the inferno but was buried in a room adjacent. Apparently, I had moved far enough over in the top room to not be directly above the now oven. Not that I was much better off. Very little air, heat from next door and two\u2026 Wait make that three cracked ribs. Once again pinned under what once would have been a rooms ceiling.<br><br>Before I passed out, I felt the earth above me shift and move away a stone head with arms reaching out to me. My saviour a more beautiful creature could not possibly exist. Then its granite dome shifted to glance at my chest. He apparently was not a fan of old Cains fashion sense. <em>Crack</em>! That would be the sound of stone meeting face as I black out thinking this has been the worst two deaths of my life.<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br><br></p>\n            </div>",

It hovered in the air, emitting a soft glow that caught my attention. I reached out to touch it, half-expecting it to vanish like a figment of my imagination.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To my astonishment, the box remained there as I blinked. I hesitated for a moment before summoning the courage to read the words displayed on its surface. It read: <br></span></p>\n<div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 98.8095%\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[21 Days]</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">My heart skipped a beat as I tried to make sense of the message. What did it mean? 21 days for what? Was this some kind of a cosmic joke? My throat still chafed like mad. The sharp, blood-red stone I had swallowed just moments ago felt like it got stuck somewhere halfway through me. Fading patterns of a monstrously complex hexagram flickered beneath my bare feet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A sinking feeling settled in the pit of my stomach. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I had always been a forsaken child, living in the magical orphanage run by the mad mage, known as Master Alaric Milgrim. Far too often Master Milgrim tested his disgusting alchemical concoctions on me and the other orphans in an attempt to break the System, to unlock it in children below 18 years of age.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It seems today that the orphanage-running bastard finally succeeded.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cYou see something, don\u2019t you, Mervin?\u201d Master Milgrim bared his yellow teeth, his thick, greasy, white beard trembling in unconcealed excitement. \u201cDo you see the blue notification window?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cIt says twenty one days,\u201d I uttered, watching electrical sparks dance between the old man\u2019s fat fingers. The fat bastard smelled lies from a mile away. I knew that if I tried to deceive him, lightning would leap from his hand into my bare wrist.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cBlink on the box with your left eye for me, Mervin,\u201d the fat man demanded. \u201cSurely, there must be more to it.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I did.</span></p>\n<div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 98.8095%\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[Cascade Error.

Warning: Soul instability detected. 21 days until total soul fracture.] </span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I read the new message out loud to him with a slow drawl, tripping over the complex words.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cDamnation,\u201d Master Milgrim spat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I gulped.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cA waste of a perfectly good philosopher's stone,\u201d the fat alchemist muttered. \u201cI was certain that it would work. No matter\u2026 no matter.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">My mind raced as I absorbed the gravity of the situation. Twenty-one days until my soul shattered and death claimed me for her own. The words echoed in my head, filling me with a sense of dread and desperation. I had always known that life in the orphanage was far from ideal, but I never imagined that my Master's experiments would lead to my demise so soon at sixteen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I clenched my fists, feeling the surge of anger and frustration course through my veins. How could he be so callous, so indifferent to the lives he toyed with? I had endured his numerous experiments, his cruelty, and now I faced an inevitable death sentence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But amidst the despair, a spark of hatred and focus flickered within me. I refused to accept my fate without a fight. I had witnessed the strength of the System firsthand, seen its potential to transform ordinary individuals into unstoppable heroes and unkillable monsters. If I had only twenty-one days left, then I would make every moment count.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The blue box, still hovering in the air, taunted me with its ominous countdown.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Master Milgrim's voice cut through my dark thoughts, his tone laced with annoyance. \"I'll have to try again, perhaps with a smaller stone,\" he muttered, dismissing the significance of my impending demise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[Stats] I thought.</span></p>\n<div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table style=\"width: 89.9533%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 24.2121%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Name:</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 71.9718%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mervinii Polliix</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 24.2121%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Age:</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 71.9718%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">16 years old<br></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 24.2121%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Species &amp; Subtype:</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 71.9718%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Human</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 24.2121%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Alignment:<br></span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 71.9718%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">-<br></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 24.2121%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Level:</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 71.9718%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">0</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 24.2121%\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width: 71.9718%\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 24.2121%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Experience:</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 71.9718%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">0/50</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 24.2121%\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width: 71.9718%\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 24.2121%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Health:</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 71.9718%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">4/16</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 24.2121%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Spiritual Stamina:</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 71.9718%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">0.1/0.1</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 24.2121%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mana:</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 71.9718%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">0.1/0.1</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 24.2121%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mana regen:</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 71.9718%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">0.1m/hr</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 24.2121%\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width: 71.9718%\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 24.2121%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Agility:</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 71.9718%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">11</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 24.2121%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dexterity:</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 71.9718%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">9</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 24.2121%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Vitality:</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 71.9718%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">7</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 24.2121%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Charisma:</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 71.9718%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 24.2121%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Magic:</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 71.9718%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">0</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 24.2121%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Luck:</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 71.9718%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 24.2121%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Intelligence:</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 71.9718%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">10</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 24.2121%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Wisdom:</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 71.9718%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">7</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 24.2121%\">\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 71.9718%\">\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 24.2121%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Augmentations:<br></span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 71.9718%\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Philosopher's Stone<br></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">All low numbers.

I knew a few that became shop salesmen in the city. I knew a lot more than I showed, in fact. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While the others went to bed, I usually crept through the halls and lockpicked the door with an old pin I kept in my nest of brown hair and read all of the fat bastard\u2019s books, an alchemist\u2019s library of a thousand tomes. Milgrim\u2019s journals made it clear to me why our Master was banned from Acadia Arcanarium and was forced to \u201cretire\u201d on the outskirts of town.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWhat do these words mean, Master?\u201d I asked, twisting my face into an expression of an idiot who didn\u2019t understand anything.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cYou\u2019ve got twenty one days of having the system,\u201d Master Milgrim lied smoothly. \u201cThere's a tracker spell on you to keep an eye on things.

I pulled on my brown tunic and exceptionally cheap leather boots and was out of the door. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The yard was a drab area surrounded by tall stone, moss covered walls. The wall wasn\u2019t an impediment to me. I rushed towards it grabbing onto the uneven stones and started climbing.

Swinging from branch to branch I was soon on the ground.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Running across yellow and orange fields, my heart beating like mad, I rushed towards the city.

Apparently, this was one of those days where he\u2019d have to have a \u201cteachable moment.\u201d It\u2019s not too much of an issue as he can just shuffle the body paragraph breakdown to make time.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying, that doesn\u2019t make sense Mr. Reed. Essays aren\u2019t emails and emails aren\u2019t essays. They\u2019re two completely different things.\u201d He looked at his friends near him for support. Seeing one give him a thumbs up, Raul sits a little higher than his usual slouched posture and gestures at the class. \u201cThis whole place is worthless. The majority of what I need to know is in auto. I\u2019m gonna be a mechanic anyways, not some college shit who thinks they\u2019re better than everyone else.\u201d</p>\n<p>Walker pauses for a moment to get a handle on himself, knowing that the college remark was for him. Pulling an empty desk forward, one of the few in his thirty-student class, he flips it around to sit facing the class. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple Raul. Do you want to be a basic mechanic all your life?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what, supervisor.?\u201d</p>\n<p>Raul thinks it over for a minute before saying, \u201cNah man, I\u2019m gonna start my own business\u201d.</p>\n<p>Walker throws a finger in the air, \u201cAha! You wanna be a business owner and maybe manager. That means you have to learn how to manage employees, including writing up reports on them and giving feedback. You\u2019ve also gotta deal with suppliers, expansion opportunities, loads of stuff. It all ties back to essays. They\u2019re critical thinking outlets.\u201d</p>\n<p>A new voice speaks up, \u201cThat\u2019s too much work man.\u201d</p>\n<p>Walker looks at the speaker. The kid was always on his phone and didn\u2019t do anything in class. Anytime a teacher tried to speak with his parents, they\u2019d either hang up the phone or bitch them out for being a \u201cshitty teacher\u201d. Honestly, he didn\u2019t know why he stayed in this job.</p>\n<p>Oh that\u2019s right, he needs money.</p>\n<p>\u201cNicholas\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNick\u201d he cut him off. \u201cYou don\u2019t even fucking know what I like to be called.\u201d</p>\n<p>Walker instantly replied by rote, \u201cLanguage please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck language. Raul\u2019s right, this is bullshit. You\u2019re just a overly paid babysitter\u201d he said, looking at Raul for backup. But he had already slouched back into his seat and was staring at the paper in front of him.</p>\n<p>Smart kid Walker thought to himself. He needed to get control back before things spiraled out of control.</p>\n<p>\u201cNick, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t say your name the way you prefer it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck your sorry bitch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rather than blow up, which he really wanted to do in that moment, and maybe take Nicholas with him, he calmly stood up and walked over to his phone.</p>\n<p>A voice quickly answered, \u201cHello Mr. Reed, how can I help you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I need an administrator here please, non-emergency.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll send one in a few minutes\u201d the distant voice promised.</p>\n<p>He walks back over and stands near the desk he\u2019d previously sat at. Smiling at the class, Walker lets them know he\u2019s going to wait a few minutes and for them to think about what they want to say in their emails. It\u2019s a basic assignment for an English class. Write the teacher a professional email with a beginning, middle, and end, that asks questions about a job they want to do in the future. Simple stuff that goes with his particular brand of teaching\u2026.practicality. If it\u2019s not useful, do your best to not teach it. Thus the current kerfluffle.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t fully disagree with Raul and Nicholas. A lot of what he\u2019s forced to teach is outdated and stupid. They, being his supervisors and the thirty other bosses he reports to, have a strict curriculum. The student body of his school is eighty percent Latino, but he\u2019s still forced to teach novels written by dead white people from two centuries ago. The students can\u2019t relate, and no matter how well-written the material is, it just doesn\u2019t connect in the way it needs to. Thank god he doesn\u2019t have to teach Moby Dick anymore. American classic though it is, good lord did it drag.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s only 10:14 a.m. in the morning. Moments like this will happen throughout the day, and while he normally wouldn\u2019t call an administrator for this, it was a recurring problem with Nicholas, and Walker was done.</p>\n<p>A light knock at the locked door informed him one of the principals had arrived. Through a small window set into a rusted door frame, he sees the tight hairbob and pasty countenance of Mrs. Wilson\u2026which means Nicholas would get a pass and just sit in her office for the rest of the period. He\u2019d see him again tomorrow. And the day after. And the day after that. Requests for students transferring to other classes are ignored more often than not. One student had assaulted a teacher and been back in that same teacher\u2019s class three days later.</p>\n<p>A second sigh came out of Walker as he opens the door and steps out, leaving it cracked so he wouldn\u2019t have to unlock it again.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you need Mr. Reed\u201d Mrs. Wilson asks in her best fake-cheery voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cI need Nicholas back there spoken to by an administrator. I\u2019ve asked a few times for him to be transferred to another class or credit recovery, but nothing\u2019s changed.\"</p>\n<p>Mrs. Wilson appeared to think it over for a moment before saying, \u201cDid you go to that professional development last weekend on dealing with difficult children? It was enlightening.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo\u201d he replies. \u201cI was busy with moving.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh that\u2019s right\u201d she says in a sympathetic voice, her facial muscles not twitching from her false smile. \u201cYou did say you couldn\u2019t make it because of a personal issue.\u201d</p>\n<p>A personal issue like the love of his life leaving him.</p>\n<p>Walker got back on topic. \u201cDo you mind pulling him out for at least the rest of the period, this is an important part of my lesson plan.\u201d</p>\n<p>She nods slowly, \u201cSure, but you\u2019ll have to think over how you want to manage him tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Walker grits his teeth.</p>\n<p>They walk in together and that\u2019s when they notice the papers all over the ground, torn into tiny pieces. Unlike a lot of newer teachers, Walker prefers to handwrite all of his lessons, and had them all grouped into one thick notebook full of neon-colored Post-it notes. He\u2019d built that notebook over the past year and hadn\u2019t thought to make a copy or digitize it. He was always real careful about making sure it was in the drawer just below the desk, so he knew right where it was at all times. It appeared Nicholas wasn\u2019t always staring at his phone after-all. The culprit stood just behind Walker\u2019s black desk with no fear of retribution.</p>\n<p>\u201cHard to fucking teach without your instructions, ain\u2019t it bitch\u201d, he says with a heavy grin leaning off of his face.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Wilson looks at the papers, not understanding their significance. \u201cThis\u2019ll clean right up\u201d she says, before asking Nicholas to follow her. She didn\u2019t notice Walker staring at his hard work slashed into pieces on the floor. The combination of neon colors, the plain white paper he preferred to work off of, and dried ink, snapped something in his mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck did you do\u201d he says, lifting his head from the floor and zero\u2019ing into Nicholas\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Reed!\u201d Mrs. Wilson says in a sharp voice.</p>\n<p>But Walker wasn\u2019t listening. He was done listening. He was done with helicopter parents screaming at him for barely earned Bs. He was done with apathetic teenagers staring at girls\u2019 asses instead of listening when he taught the things they most needed to know before entering the working world. Not like those same girls were any better. He was done with low pay, twelve-hour days, and bullshit professional development sessions taught by people who hadn\u2019t been in a classroom for years. Walker Reed is ready for a change.</p>\n<p>He squares up his shoulders and lets loose.</p>\n<p>\u201cListen here you little fuck. I worked on that for over a year, just so you could maybe, potentially, survive this world. This world that\u2019s gonna eat you alive if you don\u2019t at least have a diploma. You know how Raul wants to be a mechanic, they require diplomas at mechanic schools. Wanna go to college? Diploma. Hell, the local beautician school requires a diploma. You\u2019re looking at a life of ditch-digging and dick-sucking to make it. This is California motherfucker. Rent for the closest apartment is twice what you\u2019ll have a chance to make, not to mention budget. But you don\u2019t know what that is. The only thing you know is your mommy bought you a sweet phone and she\u2019d never kick you out. The goddamn school won\u2019t kick you out. Everyone is willing to carry your heavy-ass load because you\u2019re a teenager. But here\u2019s what I\u2019ll do. I\u2019m going to break down exactly who you\u2019re going to be by the time you\u2019re my age. Aren\u2019t I nice?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mrs. Wilson puts a hand on his shoulder, trying to get him to calm down, but it was too late. She was talking, but Walker couldn\u2019t hear her anymore. <br>Nicholas\u2019s grin was gone and the room became as quiet as a funeral. Unbeknownst to Walker, the classrooms around his had gone quiet as well, and a few recognizable teachers were sticking their heads out to listen in.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe you had a tough life, but who hasn\u2019t? Maybe you\u2019re special, but who isn\u2019t? Like a bullshit psychic, I can see your future. You\u2019ll drop out of high school after they try to hold you back because they need the money from your, quote, \u201cattendance\u201d. They\u2019ll even push to get you to graduate, but on the weekend when you\u2019re supposed to make-up hours for credits, you\u2019ll be hotboxing in some shit Prius behind a gas station where you swear to your buddies that there are no cameras. Cops will hit you up, you\u2019ll get a stain on your already tarnished record, but your life will go on and your mother will keep making excuses for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mrs. Wilson had called the school resource officers halfway into his tirade and they were urgently whispering to him to leave the area and calm down. But they weren\u2019t stopping him and Nicholas looked like he was rooted into place, lips pressed and eyes wide.</p>\n<p>\u201cEventually you\u2019re in your early twenties and being a gas station attendant just isn\u2019t the primo-lifestyle your entitled existence requires. So you find a cheap gun, because America, and rob someone. That\u2019s a big leap up in life as you sold their credit cards and kept the cash, maybe even traded in some stolen identity for kicks. Then you do it again. On the third time, someone catches you on a camera and now there\u2019s an APB out for you, that\u2019s all-points bulletin for the uninformed motherfuckers.\u201d</p>\n<p>The resource officers start to grab his arms and pull, but Walker is 6\u20193 and around 250 pounds. He\u2019ll move when he wants to move.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t know that, because you\u2019re a dumbshit who is smoking his life away with fake friends who you know, deep down inside, will leave as soon as the ride is over.\u201d</p>\n<p>The officers start pulling harder so Walker has to strain a little to stay, still looking into Nicholas\u2019s eyes. It only causes his voice to grow louder and rageful.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a girlfriend who likely has chlamydia and loves your money, so she does what you want and gets pregnant as soon as she can. Now you\u2019ve got a kid on the way, congrats Dad. You rob another person, only this one won\u2019t take your shit, and you accidentally pop off and hit him in the leg. The cops show up, you get chased overnight, piss your pants, and get caught in a dumpster in the morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>He has to grab onto the frame of the door to keep from being removed now.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut don\u2019t worry Nicholas, because now you get to see what real trouble looks like. His name is Mike and his swastika tattoo is just a fuckin decoration. He thinks you\u2019re pretty cute and he can\u2019t wait to meet you. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have a great time with Mike and your ten years in prison. When you get out you can meet your son who got to experience the same thing you did, a father in prison throughout your formative years. Isn\u2019t that great?\u201d</p>\n<p>Security gets him through the door and all the classes throughout the building have stopped. It\u2019s hard to teach when someone is screaming obscenities fifty feet away. Mrs. Wilson is speaking quietly into her radio as they pull him away, even placing a hand on the now sobbing Nicholas\u2019s arm. But Walker isn\u2019t through. He slips out of security's arms and runs to the middle of the hallway, only to stop and smile in Nicholas\u2019s direction one more time before saying, \u201cBut it\u2019s all fuck the teachers right. The ones who work hard to make sure you have a safe place where you can be informed. Where you can learn what the future has entailed for you. How\u2019s that future looking for you shitbag? Can\u2019t you wait to meet it?\u201d</p>\n<p>He turns to security and tells them he\u2019s ready to go.</p>\n<p>In the end, he didn\u2019t make them put him on administrative leave as is the usual line. He looked at the principal, informs her of his resignation immediately, and walks out to his crappy, rust-blue Dodge Durango. The highway is empty and things are looking up.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s now 10:35 a.m.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n            </div>",

        "chapter_content": "<div class=\"chapter-inner chapter-content\">\n                <p><em>7 days before the War</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Ayla knew the island as well as she knew the cabin she lived in. The red alder trees near the western coast always shed the best firewood. She finished her chores in record time and set her bundles of wood down outside the open door. The whole cabin smelled like cinnamon and fennel seed. Her dad must still be cooking.</p>\n<p>She peeked into the kitchen, her dad standing over their old stove. He dipped his finger into the pot for several seconds and then put it in his mouth before he nodded. She smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m back, Dad.\u201d</p>\n<p>He glanced over his shoulder and then smiled big and bright, lines by his eyes, teeth white. \u201cWhen\u2019d you get so fast, kid?\u201d he said. Several stains colored his white apron, a souvenir her uncle had bought him from a human boutique shop. \u201cI\u2019m not even half-way done with dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d she said as she crossed the hardwood floor from the hallway to her dad. \u201cI wanted to save some time for other things.\u201d</p>\n<p>She leaned forward over the pot, but her dad covered her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cCertainly you didn't want to spend extra time watching me cook,\u201d he said with a low chuckle.</p>\n<p>His cold hand smelled like soil after rain. She still wasn\u2019t used to the damp decaying smell. The odor used to make her wince away from him, but she\u2019d learned to suppress it.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo cheating,\u201d he said, pulling her away and then uncovering her eyes. \u201cI want your birthday dinner to be a surprise. Nice try, sweetie.\u201d</p>\n<p>She could smell caraway seed and aniseed without having to see if it was rice pudding or not. \u201cI thought maybe I'd pick up some extra ingredients...\u201d Ayla moved away from his side and opened the refrigerator. \u201cFor dinner,\u201d she added.</p>\n<p>He chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re cute.\u201d He patted the bun on her head keeping her hair out of her face and off of her neck.</p>\n<p>She frowned and raised an eyebrow. He didn\u2019t know her plan already, did he?</p>\n<p>\u201cSure. Pick up what you want. You\u2019ve got two hours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo hours?\u201d she asked. Ayla wrinkled her nose and shut the refrigerator door. It took almost an hour and a half to make a round trip to the northern tip of the island, where the door to Ekarkara hid in a rocky cliff. \u201cHow am I supposed to shop <em>and</em> wish Loran a happy\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026birthday?\u201d he finished for her with a big grin. He tugged on her bun before turning back to the stove. \u201cYou\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>How did he always know what she was going to do? Ayla didn\u2019t want to be late, but she didn\u2019t want to cut her time short in Ekarkara, either.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure I can\u2019t have a bit more time?\u201d she asked, just in case. \u201cIt\u2019s my birthday.\u201d</p>\n<p>He leaned over and kissed her on the head. \u201cI\u2019ll cry if you\u2019re late. It\u2019s my birthday, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>His brown eyes sparkled in the sunlight through the kitchen window, a harrowing comparison to the grey magic that had rolled in their depths eleven years before. She tucked the image away into the back of her mind with the mention of their shared birthday because they were the last issues she wanted to think about right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, you win. Only because I never want you to cry\u2026\u201d She gave him a hug, but peeked sideways into the pot on the stove. She smirked.</p>\n<p>It <em>was</em> rice pudding. Her favorite.</p>\n<p>He pulled away from her and grinned, sharp features softening into round cheeks. \u201cHurry on home to me, dear.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ayla waved as she headed back to the hall. \u201cSee you in two hours!\u201d</p>\n<p>She reached the northern tip of the island in thirty minutes. She climbed up Eagle Cliff\u2019s lenient slope with magic she willed into her muscles. Rich pine lingered in the sea air as she made her way to the door that led Ekarkara\u2014a city existing on a reflection of the island she lived on. She didn\u2019t understand the mechanics, but the staircase that wound down into the cliff always opened to the same spot she started in except in a seemingly different world. A world where mageians like her lived among therians like Loran.</p>\n<p>She wanted to get there faster.</p>\n<p>Ayla\u2019s palms grazed over the rock of the cliff and pressed into a small raindrop symbol. A door caved into the mountain and slid to the right. Darkness invited her in.</p>\n<p>She hurried down the spiral staircase. Cold mist clung to her body as she headed into the heart of the cliff. Half-way down, a disorienting motion moved over her limbs as her body\u2019s natural sense of direction reversed. She stopped for a second and touched a hand to the smooth stone wall to keep from tripping, but a smile slid on her face. That movement let her know she\u2019d arrived.</p>\n<p>She climbed down the second leg of the stairs. At the end, light slipped through the bottom of another door, the same raindrop symbol in the center. Ayla pressed into it and waited with bated breath as the door slid to the right again.</p>\n<p>She stepped forward into the sunlight to a panoramic view of the island and the blue waters of the Sound. Stairs carved in the stone led away from the cliff into the ancient forest below. The luscious, green trees were enormous, towering at least two times higher than the trees in the human world she\u2019d been in.</p>\n<p>Ayla\u2019s smile didn\u2019t fade.</p>\n<p>Looking across Ekarkara always rekindled the memory of her first visit to the city with her dad and mom when she was two. Her dad told her it was his greatest achievement and her younger self asked if he\u2019d made it out of confusion. Ayla could still remember the sound of her mother laughing, like soft waves against the sand. Magic enhanced her memory, but that\u2019s all she could remember. It was enough.</p>\n<p>The packed market moved in an uncoordinated mass of tanned bodies and luscious silken clothes. The heat hung above dark heads like a death wish. She weaved between people, keeping her eyes down but her ears open to the low mumbling of the crowd.</p>\n<p>Everyone was talking about the War. She didn\u2019t want to hear it.</p>\n<p>A woman with caramel-colored skin stopped her. The golden coin bracelets clinked against each other. Ayla looked at her rounded face and tried to connect a name to it. Ninve? Ninwa?</p>\n<p>\u201cAyla,\u201d she said, her smile revealing teeth with a slight yellow tint. \u201cHave you heard anything about the War?\u201d Her words had a clear ring.</p>\n<p>Ayla shook her head. She didn\u2019t have the time to stop to make conversation.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me know if you do,\u201d she said with a smile. Her dark maroon eyes brightened.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p>\n<p>The lady moved away. Maybe her name was Nisha? Her hips swayed, golden coins rattling as she joined another woman with long, black hair.</p>\n<p>Ayla smiled at them both before slipping between two men with dark, coarse shirts.</p>\n<p>As she moved in the crowd down the street, she stopped noticing faces and paid more attention to the vibrant and embroidered clothes draped around the mageian and therian women. Some wore the color of the sea while others wore the color of the trees. They wore gold coins around their necks and their waists. They looked like a beautiful painting against the colored carts lining the street.</p>\n<p>Over the chatting crowd, vendors tried to make sure anyone within five meters knew about the newest fruits, silkiest robes, and oldest books available today. Cumin, nutmeg, and allspice mixed with the sea salt air and rich pine. She wanted to buy it all, but she didn\u2019t have time. It was unfortunate.</p>\n<p>\u201cApples, oranges, bananas!\u201d a vendor a few carts down called over the crowd. \u201c600 <em>zuzu</em> each! Special low price for today only!\u201d He had a thick accent, his letters rolling over his tongue more than normal. Therians who hadn\u2019t grown up in Ekarkara tended to sound just like that.</p>\n<p>She burrowed between bodies to the wooden cart he stood behind. A couple was debating on how many bananas to purchase as she palmed an apple. Ayla tossed it up in the air and caught it. It was a bright green, lighter than fresh leaves on the trees. She was tempted to take a bite out of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou like apples?\u201d the vendor asked.</p>\n<p>He had stepped next to her and she hadn\u2019t realized. He had a coarse beard and very light, cream colored eyes. He smiled, his teeth slightly larger than normal.</p>\n<p>The first rule of the market was to never show interest in the products.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ayla said and put the apple back in its bin, clustered together with its brother and sister apples. \u201cIt looked bruised.\u201d</p>\n<p>The vender\u2019s bushy eyebrows shot up and his nostrils flared. \u201cMy apples are the best apples in the city,\u201d he said, his tongue slurring his words together. He put his fists on his hips. The therian\u2019s belly spilled over the wide cloth belt at his waist.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you them for 500 <em>zuzu</em> each,\u201d he said, frown lines in his forehead. \u201cSpecial low price for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>The second rule of the market was that it was stupid to engage in bargaining with vendors. The cart she usually went to always gave her 100 <em>zuzu</em> off the normal price. If anyone wanted a lower price, they had to trick the vendor into lowering it or become friendly with the vendor. Ayla would have to trick this one because she didn\u2019t have enough <em>zuzu</em> to buy what she wanted. She also didn\u2019t have enough time to find her usual vendor.</p>\n<p>Ayla picked a basket from the bottom of the cart with a sigh. She grabbed an apple, carefully examining for even a spot of brown on its smooth, green skin. The therian vendor watched her, licking his lips. He smiled with yellow teeth.</p>\n<p>She set it back down and then glanced at his light eyes. His face fell. Shame landed on a vendor who couldn\u2019t make a sale to a girl like her: young, mageian, and alone.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll just go to my usual cart.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c400!\u201d he said. His eyes were wide, his mouth slightly ajar.</p>\n<p>She smiled. That would be enough. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll take three.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d he said, a wolfish grin coming over his face. His pride must still be intact. \u201cMake sure to stop by again, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ayla reached out and filled the basket before she paid him for the produce with two gold coins\u2014one 1000-piece and one 200-piece. She swung the basket over her shoulder, thanked him, and left for Loran\u2019s house.</p>\n<p>Ayla glanced at the sky\u2014seven degrees after high sun. She only had time enough for the sun to move eight more degrees before she\u2019d be late. She\u2019d have to move faster.</p>\n<p>Ayla ran along the dirt path and then turned down the trail leading to Loran\u2019s house. Twigs snapped and rocks crumbled under her steps, cold magic padding her bare feet. A few people heading toward the market waved at her.</p>\n<p>As she passed by each house, anticipation rolled out of the doors. Everyone was waiting for the arrival of a trainer. One day a year, on her birthday, Ekarkara was tight with tension. The date wasn\u2019t coincidental. The trainers came to pick up the competitors for the War, but the competitors weren\u2019t picked at random. They were hand-crafted and born on the same day.</p>\n<p>Ayla never allowed useless fear get in the way of having a good time and she wasn\u2019t going to start today. Loran felt the same way.</p>\n<p>The Amedi house loomed over its neighboring houses in the distance and sat across from the only empty house in Ekarkara. It had been her house before the last War. Her family name, Elias, labeled a gold plate by the front door. She couldn\u2019t remember living in it, but she remembered visiting Loran everyday when he was still a puppy. Now he looked as human as she did.</p>\n<p>Ayla ran until she got to the Amedi house. She stopped a few feet away with a frown. The door was closed\u2014the only door she\u2019d seen closed since she got here. She approached, trying to control her breathing, and assessed the big house, blocks of rooms sitting on top of each other without any design. Blue fabric billowed in the wind in a second story window.</p>\n<p>She was about to knock on the front door when it opened. Loran\u2019s mom covered her mouth with a warm hand and pulled her inside with a gentle tug. Ayla frowned as Pejna closed the door without a noise and then put a finger to her own lips, shaking her head. Black wisps of hair caressed her cheeks. Her dancing eyes were a cream even lighter than the vendor she\u2019d met.</p>\n<p>Ayla\u2019s heart thudded in her chest as Pejna pressed her into the corner by the door. The dark house smelled like decaying leaves. She could hear a shrill voice in the living room and glanced at the stone ceiling. Who was up there?</p>\n<p>Pejna pressed her hands to Ayla\u2019s ears and looked over her shoulder toward the stairs in the left corner of the room. Ayla held her breath. Why didn\u2019t Pejna want her to hear what was going on?</p>\n<p>Ayla closed her eyes and clenched her fists. She wanted to listen in. Was Loran up there? She nudged the magic under her eyelids, icy cold, toward her ears. If she wasn\u2019t careful, Pejna would see the magic crawling along her skin and she\u2019d make Ayla leave.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want a lot of things, right?\u201d Ayla heard the shrill voice like a whisper from across the room. \u201cYou want to keep your mother safe and happy\u2014the poor thing lost her husband after all. And you want to keep your friends cheerful. I\u2019m sure you want them all to live long and prosperous lives.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do want those things.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was Loran. He <em>was</em> upstairs. Ayla\u2019s heart thudded. Pejna looked down at her, eyes narrowing, and she cupped her hands over Ayla\u2019s ears to block out the voices more.</p>\n<p>The woman continued, voice muffled, \u201cAnd you want to protect Ayla, right? Keep her from competing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ayla fought her gasp. Who was this woman?</p>\n<p>She couldn\u2019t hear what the woman was saying\u2014it was too faint for even magic-enhanced hearing to catch. Loran\u2019s voice didn\u2019t reach her ears either. Ayla kept pressing, wishing her magic could do more, begging it to hear what they were saying.</p>\n<p>Was the woman talking about competing in the War? It was unlikely for the War to happen again so soon. It only occurred once a century and her dad had competed just sixteen years before. What was going on?</p>\n<p>Ayla didn\u2019t have to worry about the War\u2026 Right?</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Ayla frowned. Her heart threw itself up her throat. What?</p>\n<p>\u201cDeal?\u201d the woman asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeal,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the house warmed with spring air. Pejna moved her hands from Ayla\u2019s ears and wrapped her arms around her shoulders. The older woman pulled her close before she reached over and opened the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cAyla,\u201d she said. Her voice wavered, but it wasn\u2019t very noticeable. \u201cIsn\u2019t it a bit late?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ayla swallowed from her spot in the corner. Pejna glanced at her and smiled\u2014tried to smile. She was trying to make it seem like Ayla had just arrived at the house. She had to play along.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014Yeah.\u201d Ayla let out a breath, trying to calm herself. If she didn\u2019t and Loran came down, he\u2019d know something was up\u2014he\u2019d know she\u2019d heard something she wasn\u2019t supposed to. Loran was like an older brother, obnoxious, all-knowing, and completely predictable.</p>\n<p>Ayla swallowed her heart back to her chest. \u201cI\u2019m in a hurry. Is Loran here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Pejna turned her head toward the stairs. \u201cLoran!\u201d she called. She turned back to Ayla. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come inside?\u201d she asked. After a few moments, she shut the door.</p>\n<p>Ayla had to hand it to Pejna. She possessed a talent for tricking her son. Ayla wished she had it, too.</p>\n<p>Ayla heard Loran\u2019s feet moving across the ceiling before the stairs creaked and he appeared at the top. He hurried down and smiled.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Ayla,\u201d he said, his voice deep. His dark hair was messy, as if he\u2019d been running his fingers through it. He did that when he was nervous.</p>\n<p>Pejna gave Ayla a quick smile, a little hug, and headed upstairs. She placed a hearty pat on Loran\u2019s arm as she passed him.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s in a hurry,\u201d his mom said, \u201cif you didn\u2019t hear. Better be quick about wishing her a happy birthday.\u201d</p>\n<p>Loran rolled his eyes as his mom laughed her way up the stairs. Ayla wondered how she could pretend nothing had just happened. She watched the woman\u2019s curvy figure until she disappeared to the second floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t go back home without saying bye?\u201d he teased, a grin spreading across his face. He wore a sleeveless shirt tucked into a traditional belt. A light perspiration glistened across his muscular arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me correct you,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t leave without saying happy birthday.\u201d She smiled up to his vibrant blue eyes and hoped she looked normal. It was hard to trick a boy who could see magic jumping off her skin when she was nervous or upset.</p>\n<p>His angular face softened as he returned her smile. \u201cCelebrating with your dad again this year?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, of course. Nothing like partying with a dead man.\u201d She tried to laugh. His joke always felt like a weight pressing down on her chest. Loran didn\u2019t actually know she <em>was</em> celebrating with her dad. He couldn\u2019t know.</p>\n<p>It was a secret only a few people carried. Her dad didn\u2019t want Loran to be one of them.</p>\n<p>She continued, \u201cIt\u2019s too bad you can\u2019t visit and celebrate with me instead.\u201d</p>\n<p>He shrugged. His shirt rippled against his lean body. \u201cMaybe someday.\u201d Ayla lowered her eyes\u2014he\u2019d said that every year for the past eight years.</p>\n<p>Loran chuckled, a rhythm that reminded her of a steady flowing river trickling over rocks. She looked at him as he leaned toward her, her eyes falling on the small bump on his nose she\u2019d given him when she was twelve. He smelled like air before rain, as always.</p>\n<p>Loran whispered, \u201cWell, happy birthday, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>His eyes sparkled as he pressed his lips to her cheeks. She felt them flush as he moved away. The big grin on his face told her that he could see it and it was only a matter of seconds before he\u2019d tease her. Why was the kissing a tradition? She hated it\u2014sort of.</p>\n<p>\u201cEven after sixteen years,\u201d he said as he straightened up, \u201cyou still blush the same color.\u201d Loran brushed away some hair from her face. \u201cYour magic is an even prettier shade, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>She rolled her eyes and took a breath to calm her nerves, shoving his hand away from her face. \u201cI\u2019m glad one of us can tell.\u201d</p>\n<p>He laughed and messed up the bun on the top of her head. \u201cHave a safe journey home, Ayla.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ayla swatted at his bigger hands. \u201cAs always,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Loran\u2019s mouth opened with a smirk in the corner of his lips, but it lowered\u2014his lips closing together and his teeth clinking. Ayla watched his face harden.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d A dimple appeared on his right cheek. \u201cBye.\u201d</p>\n<p>The color of his eyes rippled like rain against a puddle, magic swam against her skin, and a twinge pulled at her face as if the veins in her cheeks had shriveled up.</p>\n<p>There was something tight and foreign about his features she couldn\u2019t place. She\u2019d seen him every day for the past eight years, yet she didn\u2019t understand his taut jaw, his seeping magic, or the storm in his eyes. He was always relaxed, in control, and calm, just like his magic.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be late,\u201d he said, his eyebrows raising a fraction.</p>\n<p>She took a few steps back. Why had their conversation turned out like this?</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, thanks,\u201d she said and tried to smile as she waved an arm to wave.</p>\n<p>His shoulders were rigid as he waved back. Ayla opened the door and sprinted out. Did his reaction have to do with the conversation she\u2019d tried to overhear?</p>\n<p>She raced back through the trails again toward the cliff that\u2019d take her back to the human world and to her cabin on Cypress Island. She wondered about the deal he\u2019d made, but she\u2019d have to wait for tomorrow to ask.</p>\n<p>Ayla almost tripped over her own feet\u2014Loran hadn\u2019t promised he\u2019d see her tomorrow. He always did. They always said it\u2014every day for the last eight years.</p>\n<p>Maybe he <em>was</em> worried about the War, like the rest of the mageians and therians in Ekarkara. It <em>was</em> something to be concerned about, but after sixteen years, she\u2019d grown tired of the whole idea. If the War happened, she\u2019d be in it, and that was it. Her and those twenty others.</p>\n<p>Had Loran not promised to see her tomorrow because the War <em>was</em> going to happen this year? If it was, why did he know when she didn\u2019t?</p>\n<p>The War couldn\u2019t be this year. He would\u2019ve told her and she would\u2019ve probably known by now, too. There had to be something else bothering him. If he didn\u2019t tell her by the end of the week, she\u2019d give him the silent treatment. Always worked.</p>\n<p>She called on the cold of her magic to seep back into her muscles. Either way, she really needed to make it home on time. Her dad possessed a killer pout. She pushed Loran out of her mind and set her legs in her icy magic.</p>\n            </div>",

        "chapter_content": "<div class=\"chapter-inner chapter-content\">\n                <p>I will never forget the day that I met General Ognyan Spitignov, so it is there I shall begin my story.</p>\n<p>We were still asleep in the barracks when the colonel came in to tell everybody that we needed to be ready for a surprise inspection on the parade ground and that a very important person was riding out to our outpost. He was waving a sheet of paper as he told us this, then put the paper on a table and rushed off to shake awake the heavier sleepers of our battalion.</p>\n<p>I have always been possessed of an extra measure of curiosity, and unlike many of my fellow soldiers I could read very well, and so it was that I was able to catch a glance of the name on the paper: General Ognyan Spitignov. I whispered this to my bunkmate Vitold as we hastily rummaged through our locker looking for our dress uniforms.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span>General Ognyan Spitignov</span>? The Butcher of Belz is coming here?\" Vitold didn\u2019t seem to believe it at first, but his blurted response was loud enough to draw a glare from the colonel, who told us in terms I would rather not write down that we should avoid calling the esteemed war mage \u201cButcher\u201d to his face. The barracks burst into noise, the hubbub of many soldiers trying to talk at once, and I busied myself trying to find the boxes with our dress uniforms.</p>\n<p>Somewhere beneath our regular mechanics\u2019 pullovers, our stash of vodka, the playing cards, and that extra toolkit I won from Karlov last week were our fancy parade uniforms, the ones we weren\u2019t supposed to touch or get any grease on. We hadn\u2019t even done more than take a quick peek at them still in the boxes when the supply officer issued them to us last month. We\u2019d marveled at the deep red color of the capes while carefully avoiding touching them with our grease-stained fingers.</p>\n<p>I found the boxes, but as I pulled out the red cape on top, it turned out that <span>my box</span> contained only the red capes \u2013 half a dozen each in my box and, worse, another half dozen in Vitold\u2019s. No fancy coats, no fancy belts, no fancy pants, no fancy hats, just <span>a dozen</span> capes in a mislabeled pair of little wooden boxes. It was now my turn to run through my vocabulary of unprintable epithets, though unlike the colonel, I did so discreetly, under my breath, rather than at the top of my lungs.</p>\n<p>Vitold, however, had a practical suggestion.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, Mikolai,\" he said, \u201cYuri and Igor have a weekend pass and are passed out drunk somewhere off in town. They will not mind if we borrow their dress uniforms.\" He gestured with a hairpin at the locker next to ours.</p>\n<p>Yuri and Igor were the steam knights who bunked in the next row over from ours; the four of us often played cards together. Between them, they were the thinnest and fattest of the steam knights, which is one reason we knew them so well; they\u2019d gotten new (or rather, newly reconditioned) powered suits issued to them when their unit got rotated to the garrison. Being somewhat non-standard in size, they had both wanted their suits to be adjusted to fit better. The crew chief wouldn\u2019t sign for it without a bribe, so Igor and Yuri decided to cut out the middleman and pay Vitold and me directly.</p>\n<p>I thought borrowing our friends\u2019 uniforms seemed like a brilliant idea; and a few minutes later, I was wearing Igor\u2019s too-large dress uniform with the belt looped half an extra turn around my waist, while Vitold, being the smaller of the two of us, was squeezed into Yuri\u2019s too-small dress uniform. I kissed my good-luck stone \u2013 the one an old lady living out in the forest had given me for chopping wood for her when I was a young boy \u2013 and tucked it under my shirt collar.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We were nearly the last ones onto the parade ground, hustling to join the rear rank just as General Spitignov stepped out of the carriage. He was a very large and exceedingly ugly man wearing a war mage\u2019s under-armor harness, and as he stumped around, he muttered to himself as much as to anyone else. Every so often, he stopped to look at someone more closely. I kept my eyes straight forward and my arms rigidly at my sides as I strained to try to hear what he was saying.</p>\n<p>After what <span>felt</span> like three hours but was probably closer to ten minutes, he reached our rank and stopped right in front of me. He was taller than most men, able to look me in the eyes without peering upwards or downwards, and his rune-tattooed arms were as thick around as my legs. I\u2019d met taller men, like my cousin Konstantin, but I\u2019d never met a man who made me feel small and delicate before. He fingered my collar, poked at my chest, then rasped out a word as I started to sweat nervously.</p>\n<p>\u201cName?\"</p>\n<p>\u201cMikolai Stepanovich, sir!\" My voice cracked.</p>\n<p>He paused and then pointed to my hand. I held it up, looking at it, and then back at him, puzzled.</p>\n<p>\u201cSir?\"</p>\n<p>He rasped out another word. \u201cGrease?\" he asked.</p>\n<p>I looked down at my hand and at the stubborn black rims underneath the fingernails.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, yes, sir.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. Not afraid to get your hands dirty.\" His eyes unfocused a bit. \u201cI like that in a steam knight. Ten year service badge,\" he waved at my borrowed jacket. \u201c<span>M</span>aintains his own suit personally and regularly even out here. Loyal, diligent and willing to get his hands dirty. That\u2019s the sort of steam knight I like.\" He focused again, glanced over at Vitold, looked down at his grease-spotted hand, up at his collar, and then back to me.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou two are good comrades?\"</p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t know how to correct the misapprehensions of the large ugly man in front of me without getting into trouble, didn\u2019t like him talking about me as if to some invisible third person, and didn\u2019t want to endure his halitosis any longer, so I gave the simple answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir.\"</p>\n<p>This was, apparently, a satisfactory answer, as the <span>general</span> nodded, and moved down along the line. I let out a breath I didn\u2019t know I was holding, and watched out of the corner of my eye as the general worked his way down the rest of the line, then circled back up around to the front of the parade ground. He spent a couple of minutes talking quietly to a small weasel-faced man. <span>T</span>he lot of us stood nervously as he pointed up and down the line while muttering inaudible, and then demonstrated that he could speak above a mutter by dismissing us.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>After changing back out of our borrowed parade uniforms and having a late \u2013 and cold \u2013 breakfast of porridge, we were sent to go work on the battalion\u2019s heavy equipment. Apparently, the general was going to take a platoon or so of hand-picked volunteers with him for some hush-hush mission, and the train would be leaving tonight.</p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t know who exactly was dumb enough to volunteer to leave a nice garrison post in one of the quieter areas of Ruthenia to go off on some hush-hush mission with <span>a war mage of questionable sanity</span> \u2013 that sounded like a recipe for getting dead in a hurry \u2013 but could they at least have chosen to kill themselves in a way that didn\u2019t leave me working for ten straight hours on steam knight boilers?</p>\n<p>Well, at least we got done in time for dinner. Vitold and I were looking forward to this, and had a bet to settle: I was hoping that with a very important visitor present, the officers would have rounded up the best cooks in the battalion for mess hall duty, while Vitold was hoping I would owe him ten kopeks for being wrong.</p>\n<p>The borscht looked and smelled familiar. Two days ago, one of the new conscripts dropped the mess sergeant's prized box of turmeric into the cookpot while making borscht, turning it a bright yellow-orange color and imparting a strange and exotic flavor to it. It showed up yesterday again since nobody with a lick of sense had eaten any, and its repeat appearance today was accompanied by a brusque order announcing that borscht was not an optional part of our meal today. It goes without saying Vitold, who would eat nearly anything, had already had seconds at dinner both yesterday and the day before \u2013 he loved complaining, and it gave him a good excuse.</p>\n<p>The bread looked like it had been baked today. I say that not because it looked or smelled particularly appealing, but because never before had I seen rye bread so dense and hard \u2013 it looked strange and unfamiliar (unlike yesterday\u2019s borscht) and wasn\u2019t the least bit moldy (unlike most of the bread we had seen this week). As we headed for our seats, Vitold \u2013 who grew up in a bakery \u2013 cheerfully informed me that he had made bread so dense and hard once, when he forgot to add yeast.</p>\n<p>When I asked him how he could be so cheerful about the matter, he reminded me that I now owed him <span>ten</span> kopeks. I was fishing through my pockets when a hand placed itself on my shoulder in a comradely way, accompanied by a familiar booming voice congratulating me on my bravery and patriotism. I turned to greet the owner of the hand with a sense of trepidation.</p>\n<p>\u201cColonel Illinich! What can I do for you today, sir?\" I eyed the colonel warily. He was smiling entirely too widely.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor me? Ah, I am afraid there is nothing you can do for me. I just wished to congratulate you on volunteering, and wish you luck on your glorious mission.\u201d The colonel leaned forward.</p>\n<p>\u201cVolunteering, sir?\" I shot a look at Vitold, who shook his head in wide-eyed innocence. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cGeneral Spitignov was very impressed with you. You have volunteered to accompany him on his mission, since the war mage specifically requested you. By name \u2013 and there are no other Mikolai Stepanoviches in the battalion.\" The colonel gave me a stern look.</p>\n<p>Odd, the colonel didn\u2019t look delusional. Had I volunteered for something without realizing it? I opened my mouth to object and then looked around the dining hall. No small number of heads were turned to look at the two of us, some sympathetic, and some gleeful. I shut my mouth as the real meaning of his statement filtered through my head. That kind of volunteering. As someone who enlisted in order to avoid being conscripted, I understood that kind of volunteering all too well.</p>\n<p>The colonel placed a pair of papers on the table and spoke more quietly. \u201cThese are the official orders attaching you two jokers to Spitignov\u2019s command. The train leaves two hours from now. Good luck.\"</p>\n<p>Vitold and I looked at each other blankly for a moment, shocked. When I looked back at the colonel, he was gone. I broke off a piece of rye brick, dipped it in the yellow-orange stew (I could hardly bring myself to think of the odd-flavored stew as \u201cborscht\u201d), and chewed mechanically. It tasted like ashes in my mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy me? He didn\u2019t ask for my name and didn\u2019t talk to me, it was all just you,\" my formerly inseparable buddy said. \u201cMaybe I can get out of this. I could be sick from food poisoning,\" he said hopefully, spooning bright yellow-orange borscht into his mouth with renewed vigor.</p>\n<p>I read the papers. \u201cYour name is right there on these. Maybe the colonel wants to get rid of you. You did put itching powder in his boots, after all.\" I pushed my plate away, my appetite having disappeared <span>at</span> the last minute. \u201cDo you want to chance having the Butcher of Belz himself mark you down as a deserter?\"</p>\n<p>Vitold shook his head as he chewed.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, me neither. I\u2019ll go pack our gear. This one\u2019s yours, this one\u2019s mine,\" I passed him one of the sheets and left the dining hall.</p>\n<p>My first stop was the mechanics\u2019 workshop, where I packed up our toolkits and a few useful extra bits, and then hustled back to the barracks. I was surprised I didn\u2019t see Vitold there waiting for me \u2013 was he still eating? What was taking him so long?</p>\n<p>I packed away what I could into our locker, and in a couple of minutes Vitold came in through the door, carrying a bag.</p>\n<p>\u201cVitold, we\u2019re nearly late,\" I said. He informed me that he had procured a cart for us to ride in style to the train depot, and that we would not possibly be late. I carried the locker out to the cart; shortly thereafter changing places with Vitold, as the mule wasn\u2019t particularly inclined to listen to him. Vitold grew up in a bakery, rather than a farm, and didn\u2019t really have much experience with talking to mules. I politely asked the mule if he would kindly hurry on his way, and he did.</p>\n<p>We very nearly were late, in spite of the borrowed cart. The gray sky of late summer\u2019s eve was punctuated with a line of smoke and ash drawing near even as we crested the last hill before the depot. At the depot, I could see the giant ugly man standing and scowling as the train pulled up. Most of the soldiers had gotten on when the two of us finished making it down the hill to the train, where a rodent-like fellow with a clipboard accosted us.</p>\n<p>Being a bright fellow, he evidently figured out that we were mechanics from our grease-stained coveralls and the toolkits we unloaded from our cart, and directed us to the task of loading a pile of disassembled steam knight suits into a boxcar. When that was done, we ourselves made as if to climb into a passenger car, at which point he informed us that we didn\u2019t need to come along, though he appreciated our enthusiasm. After all, they only had enough space in the sleeping compartments for the two last steam knights, who should be showing up at any minute, and our commanding officer wouldn\u2019t appreciate our unexpected departure from his battalion.</p>\n<p>I told him I had orders to go on that train. He rolled his eyes at me in disbelief and informed me that General Spitignov didn\u2019t need any more mechanics, and if my name wasn\u2019t on his list, I was not getting on the train to hitch a free ride south to Khoryvsk at the expense of the <span>Imperial Army</span>. I pulled out my orders, waved them in his general direction, and told him that Ognyan himself had personally requested my presence on this mission. He checked the paper against the one on his clipboard, sighed, and waved me and Vitold aboard.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was that all about?\" Vitold asked me, looking at me suspiciously. \u201cDid you just pass up an opportunity to get us out of this? He didn\u2019t seem to want to let us on.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cHe wanted to make sure our names were on the list. Which they are, he just didn\u2019t realize we\u2019re mechanics. We\u2019d get in a lot of trouble if we stayed behind.\" I sighed. \u201cLet\u2019s get settled in and claim those last two bunks before the steam knights show up. It\u2019s going to be a very long ride, and I\u2019d like to get some sleep.\" Finding the last open pair of bunks proved to be easy \u2013 they were right next to the door. We were stowing our gear (or rather, I was stowing our gear while Vitold stared unhappily out a window) when the train lurched into motion.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought there were two more steam knights coming,\" Vitold said. \u201cNobody else done came down the hill. Guess we\u2019re leaving without them.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cGood for us, bad for them,\" I said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to fight anybody for the bunk, and they\u2019re on the <span>general\u2019s</span> bad side now. I wouldn\u2019t want to be in their shoes the next time he sees them.\"</p>\n<p>Vitold rummaged in his mysterious bag and pulled out a flaky pastry of some sort. It looked like something you\u2019d see in a French bakery. \u201cEat, Mikolai, I raided the officers\u2019 pantry on my way out of the mess hall. You look like you\u2019re about to fall over.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cVitold, you\u2019re a good comrade,\" I told him, gratefully, and tore into it. It was fluffy, buttery, and had some kind of wonderful sweet filling.</p>\n            </div>",

You must be very ambitious.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Yes, exactly. Ambition was in my name and so was the essence of humanitarian ideals. My parents must have named their beloved daughter while ignoring that my name also insinuated tragedy, disappointment, and cynicism\u2014all of which my father deeply felt when I failed the National College Entrance Examination and was sentenced to a shameful job. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The glow from my laptop screen illuminated my pale face in the dark apartment room. I sat on an old spinning chair, and my head rested atop my folded knees. My short black hair was brushed out of my face and tucked behind my ears, my bangs wrapped around a velcro hair roller stuck on the top of my head. I saw the notification pop up on my screen and opened up the web novel site, reading the comment under Chapter 3,649\u2014my most recent chapter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fourteen year old me thought a pen name would fix my doomed fate, even if it were just for a stupid web novel I was writing. I both bitterly and pridefully settled on JiaLi1825</span><strong> </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">which meant \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbeautiful\u201d girl. Almost ten years later, my lonely and unremarkable life could be summed up as such: Wu Peijin, twenty-four, single, pest control. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I kept updating the web novel daily, though, and I suppose that\u2019s where all my ambition ended up. It was a pretty clich\u00e9, mass-produced web novel. A classic, depressed but resourceful, male protagonist with a lousy job, no prospects, a scummy apartment\u2026wait.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Well, I guess writing was escapism.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cDamnit, my life sucks,\u201d I groaned while bashing my head against my scraped and battered desk. The comment glared at me from my screen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Qiu Feiyu was my handsome and generic protagonist, but I had poured my heart into writing him. Sometimes, it felt like I was writing this entire story for him\u2026 or maybe for the stranger I based him off of. Teleported into a world dominated by divinities, demons, and ghosts under a game system, Feiyu had to cleverly escape dangerous challenges. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Even in the first chapter, Feiyu had to intelligently navigate and survive a challenge that would kill more than half of the population in a flash. Things weren't necessarily easy for him, and I took joy in that thought.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Although I initially wrote for my own fulfillment, projecting myself into these characters, I started writing basic tropes for readers. Numbers going up on the infinite dungeon grind, blue boxes, Demon Kings, goblins\u2014all of it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Except for anything romantic. I was single. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Hey, the people liked what they were familiar with. But at some point, I didn\u2019t. If a part of me was proud of my work, it was long, long gone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thanks to my childhood self, I had enough funds to get through every month. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Surviving My First Run </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">was successful, having garnered around eight million total views. But it didn\u2019t help that the greedy web novel contract meant I was barely making any of my profits, or that I drove away most readers with my allegedly confrontational personality. My Paytron account was enough though, and I even let users buy their way into the storyline as characters. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">HolyMapleSyrup: Thank you for the chapter! I\u2019m a bit confused\u2026 isn\u2019t Feiyu on his first run? He shouldn\u2019t have any buffs from previous regressions that wouldn\u2019t exist. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">JiaLi1825: Does it really matter? He got the staff from a divinity anyway.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">HolyMapleSyrup: Just wanted to point out a consistency issue if you cared to fix it.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">JiaLi1825: Stop reading if it bothers you so much.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">HolyMapleSyrup: It\u2019s a minor issue. No need to get so defensive.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I scoffed at the messages before reporting the user for harassment and deleting the comments. If HolyMapleSyrup cared so much about a story I was writing, he could write his own. I stood up, kicked my chair in, and walked through my cluttered and tiny apartment for a meal. After saying a small prayer half-heartedly, I used long black chopsticks to stir the steamed white rice with some marinated pork before going back to my cluttered room.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The small mailbox for private messages had a new little red notification, and I clicked on it apprehensively. Realizing it was HolyMapleSyrup, I let out a frustrated groan but continued reading.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">HolyMapleSyrup: I didn\u2019t mean to offend you. I simply had a question about the content, but there was no need to act so rudely and report me for my feedback. You forget who your readers are, and how they\u2019ve brought you to this point. You\u2019re going to regret deleting my messages, Jia Li. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Unable to hold myself back, I furiously typed up a response with greasy fingertips on my black keyboard.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">JiaLi1825: You're the exact kind of person that sucks the joy out of creation. You whine and nag like a dropped baby until you get what you want with that entitled and snobby attitude of yours. I'm writing for free, but you still want more, more, more. There are millions of books out there, and if you don't like this one, write your own. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">HolyMapleSyrup: Tomorrow, 1p.m. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">JiaLi1825: ??? The fuck are you on about now???</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">HolyMapleSyrup: I have a surprise for you.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I glared at my computer screen for a moment longer before reporting HolyMapleSyrup again and blocking him. Seriously, who\u2019d go out of their way to threaten someone who had so generously written a story for an entire decade? What a narcissist. And his username was stupid.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These were the ignorant thoughts I had the night before the entire world would change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And, please, don\u2019t look for me. If you\u2019re reading this, rest assured knowing this is what I wanted. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Next Day</span></em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThis place is a complete dump.\u201d I was donned in white protective gear, my black bob tied up in a short ponytail as I surveyed the infested house teeming with cockroaches and bedbugs. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how people live here let alone let it get this bad.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fat brown cockroaches hissed and clicked, some darting and flying away as I awkwardly shifted throughout the room.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Yang stood up after wrapping the dirtied white couch with a clear plastic wrap to trap in the insects. He wore a matching plastic suit, large goggles plastered over his eyes. They were fogging up now, and sweat collected on the interior. \u201cDon\u2019t be so judgemental, Peijin. A lot of them struggle with their mental health.\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cIf only I didn\u2019t flunk that stupid college test\u2026\u201d I muttered, letting out an exaggerated sigh as I helped clean up. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI don\u2019t know, I find it rewarding to help them,\u201d Yang said with a light smile, and I could see the large beads of sweat trickling down his forehead. He was working much harder than I was. \u201cIt\u2019s helping them get their life back in order, you know? I\u2019d hope someone would do the same for me.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I looked at him, my eyes narrowed in suspicion at his words. We\u2019d been working together for a while, and seeing him smiling up close, I could see why many in our office found him attractive\u2014light brown hair and deep brown eyes that caught and reflected light perfectly, almost making his irises a sienna or orange color. Even as he wiped the sweat off of his forehead with the back of his gloved hand, he looked as if he were glowing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But Yang was a completely different person than me, and we ended up at this job for those different reasons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I hated how perfect he was, but I didn\u2019t hate Yang. \u201cI don\u2019t get how people like you are real, or how you even survived this long,\u201d I exhaled, suddenly slapping my leg when I felt a crawling sensation. I looked down, realizing there was a puncture in my suit and a crushed cockroach on my hand. \u201cShit\u2026.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Yang peeked over, and I watched his face twist into a teasing grin. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. You brought the steamer, right?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWeren\u2019t you supposed to pack it?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cYou always pack it, Peijin.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201c...\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We always needed to bring a steamer to kill all of the bugs that might be on our clothing, jammed in the soles of our shoes, or hiding in furniture. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Yang stared down at me considerately. \u201cLet me drive back to the office to pick one up. My suit is fine, so it\u2019s unlikely I\u2019ll bring back any bugs.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Damn his kindness! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s my fault. I don\u2019t want you getting in trouble or bringing an infestation back to your home,\u201d I insisted. \u201cLet\u2019s just finish up and when we get back to the office, I\u2019ll call them and ask for a steamer. I\u2019ll deal with the consequences.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cConfident.\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Even though I didn\u2019t apologize, Yang spoke as if I did. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Rookie mistake,\u201d he said, giving another toothy grin as he went to lift the couch into the truck. \u201cI\u2019ll head back with you and vouch for you if needed.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I didn\u2019t know how he could put up with me or how he could remain this calm. He was so understanding that it was irritating, but I was glad I made the error with him there and not someone else.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We lifted the couch into the car trunk and flung off any visible bugs before unsuiting. I thought back to my cluttered, dirty apartment; just a few bed bugs caught on my shoes could be a complete disaster. My face flushed a light pink as I remembered the earlier conversation where I had judged the client\u2019s home.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I groaned, gripping the steering wheel and pressing my forehead against the center. \u201cWhy is my life so bad?\u201d I sniffled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cMaybe because you failed your college entrance exam?\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cShut up.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Yang typed the directions back to the office on my phone and set it on the dashboard for me to see. \u201cWe\u2019ll get there by 1:17 pm. At worst, there might be just a few loose bed bugs, but I think we got most,\u201d he grinned. \u201cDo you mind if I listen to my podcast?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cYou listen to podcasts? That\u2019s really weird.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cH-hey!\u201d He pointed a finger at me as I laughed, pulling onto the freeway. \u201cAmerican politics are so fascinating. I want to move there in the future.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I hated to admit it, but it was thrilling to watch Yang speak\u2014he was diligent and a good person, and when he spoke, his glowing eyes seemed to focus just on you, and it made you feel like the only person in the world.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI\u2019m trying to learn English,\u201d I reply in a feeble attempt to look cool, tilting my chin up a bit while keeping my eyes on the freeway to ignore his stare.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cOh really? Are you watching English shows or taking any lessons?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI read English novels.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWhat novels?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I paused, trying and failing to elaborate on the lie. Well, it wasn\u2019t like I was completely lying, but I wasn\u2019t going to list off English web novels\u2014that would be completely embarrassing in front of someone as studious as Yang. Suddenly, The Potentate by BananaDragon became Shakespeare.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI\u2019m reading\u2026 Shakespeare.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Yang gasped, looking at me in awe from the passenger seat. \u201cReally? Wow, that\u2019s so impressive! You should help me with my English. Which story are you reading?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cUmm\u2026 the one about the two lovers.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cOh, Romeo and Juliet?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cYeah, yeah that one.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Yang\u2019s face lit up into a bright smile as he continued, \u201cI\u2019m reading Fitzgerald right now, and it\u2019s been very difficult. Do you have any advice?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I didn\u2019t even recognize the name of that author.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cJust read a lot. You\u2019ll get there, since you\u2019re very smart.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I laughed awkwardly before turning my focus back to the road, both embarrassed and a bit ashamed. A notification pinged suddenly on my phone, blocking the map\u2019s directions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Yang was quick to react: \u201cLet me switch it back to the map,\u201d he chimed in. He went to tap on my phone but paused. \u201cHolyMapleSyrup sent you a message. They said \u2018</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thanks for writing Surviving My First Round. As promised, here\u2019s the surprise. [Open attachment.]</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2019\u201d</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">My eyes widened as I looked at the time. 12:59 pm. They couldn\u2019t even time it right. Didn\u2019t I block them? They shouldn\u2019t be able to send any messages. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cOh, I have no idea what they\u2019re talking about,\u201d I played it off, rubbing the back of my neck.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cDo you write web novels? Isn\u2019t </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Surviving My First Round</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> super famous?\u201d he turned to me, looking amazed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWhat are you talking about? I\u2019ve never heard of that,\u201d I pursed my lips, swallowing and continuing to look down the freeway.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">My phone pinged again, and Yang peeked over. \u201cThey sent another message. \u2018</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Why hide it if you wrote it?</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2019\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">My blood ran cold, and I could feel my throat thickening from anxiety and anticipation. Was this guy some freaky stalker? </span></p>\n<div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 98.6966%; text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Your free trial on Planet-2099 has ended.</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2026 What?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I looked at the time on my phone. 1 p.m. On the dot. I reread the blue screen that had appeared in front of me, and by the shocked expression on Yang\u2019s face, I could tell he saw it, too.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A sudden bright flash and subsequent boom erupted on the freeway a few cars ahead of me. Yang screamed out and gripped my arm as I suddenly swerved into the emergency lane, trying to avoid the ensuing chaos. Cars crashed and swerved desperately, their drivers and passengers surprised by the explosion and trying to get away.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A small dragon, no bigger than a toy poodle, appeared out of the bright blue blast, floating in the air and unfurling itself. It moved its limbs awkwardly, like a newborn giraffe trying to learn how to stand, and it blinked each eye at different times before they would eventually sync. My jaw dropped as I stared at the creature.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[\u00a1\u2122\u00a3\u00a2\u221e\u00a7\u00b6\u2022\u00aa\u00ba]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The dragon seemed to speak in a foreign language\u2014no, a completely new </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">language\u2014before opening up a glowing blue table, fidgeting with the buttons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One of the four navigational Gods would suddenly appear on the freeway, and for the first time, it would open its eyes and find humanity.

What is this?\u201d Yang seemed to shrink in front of me as he tugged on my sleeve, shaking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I gave him a reassuring squeeze, my heart beating out of my chest. \u201cYang, don\u2019t say a word.

I could have ignored the phone buzzing\u2014the clock read 2:50 AM\u2014but I <em>had</em> to know if it was him texting.</p>\n<p><em>&lt;Hey, Annie. Can</em><em>\u2019t sleep. What are you up to? - Peter, 12:24&gt;</em></p>\n<p><em>&lt;I miss you. Plans tomorrow night? - Peter, 1:13&gt;</em></p>\n<p>His survival was in serious doubt. He knew my plans for tomorrow night already. Packing. At least the messages weren\u2019t from Riverside\u2019s greatest\u2014and only\u2014supervillain, though.</p>\n<p><em>&lt;Feeling bored. Might do something bad later - Peter, 2:48&gt;</em></p>\n<p>I groaned, silenced his number, and rolled over. The cool night breeze off the river blew in, filling the room with the smell of freshly-watered grass and early autumn flowers. I shut the window. Curling into a ball, I tried to set aside the threatening text. Maybe I could ignore it all. Maybe this time, he wouldn\u2019t follow through on his threat. Maybe I wouldn\u2019t have to suit up and stop him. My eyes drifted closed.</p>\n<p>My phone buzzed again. I glared, grabbed it, and jammed my finger against the unlock buttons.</p>\n<p><em>&lt;One more time, for old times</em><em>\u2019 sake!

The idiot had started an Episode? Of course he\u2019d pull something like this tonight! I hugged my plushie cat, wishing I could just <em>sleep</em>.</p>\n<p>Then I pulled myself out of bed and felt my way to the light switch. It wasn\u2019t fair. I didn\u2019t want to answer the <strong>[Casting Call]</strong>. I wanted to sleep. But I was the only hero in Riverside\u2014aside from my sidekick Collidus, and the kid needed his sleep more than I did. I flicked on the light.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d been in other girls\u2019 rooms throughout high school but never invited anyone over to mine. Except Peter. He understood. It was frozen in time\u2013the perfect early-middle-schooler\u2019s room. Pink bedding covered my twin bed, and the frame around my mirror was a bright purple. Posters of superheroines\u2014all signed and old and yellowed from Mom\u2019s secondhand smoke\u2014adorned the walls. A framed picture of my high school play\u2019s cast sat on the nightstand. And on my pillow lay a white cat plushie with pink-and-blue star-button eyes and two limp cloth tails.</p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t want to do this. I needed my sleep before the big move. But someone had to stop Professor Panic and his Panic Pals, and the police couldn\u2019t compete with the young mad scientist\u2019s inventions. Or, if I was being honest, his sense of presentation. Of Cunning, Drama, and Flamboyance, which the System wanted so badly. Neither could I.</p>\n<p>At least, not in my pink footie pajamas!</p>\n<p>\u201cWake up, Tails,\u201d I said, pointing at the plushie and accepting the <strong>[Casting Call]</strong>. \u201cThere\u2019s a new episode at the bank, and Peter needs our help. We have to go now.\u201d If I hurried, I could stop him before he did something <em>really</em> stupid.</p>\n<p><strong> [Professor Panic</strong><strong>\u2019s Payoff Plan:</strong> Act One in Progress<strong>]</strong></p>\n<p>A pink, star-shaped spark slipped from my finger and touched the cat plushie\u2019s head as I pointed. Its star eyes glowed and started spinning, and it stretched just like a real cat.</p>\n<p><em>&lt;Oh, Anika, we</em><em>\u2019re saving the day again? Nya!&gt;</em> Tails\u2019 high-pitched voice echoed in my head. <em>&lt;Remember, you have to swear on something you\u2014&gt;</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI know, Tails. We don\u2019t have time,\u201d I grumbled. Quietly. Then I grabbed the cat plushie and held it over my head.</p>\n<p>\u201cI swear on my family, who I love very much, that I\u2019ll stand up against Professor Panther, his minions, and evil all over Riverside! I\u2019ll fight for justice, peace, and hope! And I\u2019ll never stop \u2018til evil does first!\u201d I never, ever called Peter Professor Panic during an Episode. Nicknames were too much fun!</p>\n<p>I\u2019d made my oath up when I was thirteen, and it was suited for the little leagues. But I was eighteen now, and super-cringy, and I didn\u2019t want to be a little leaguer anymore. Squeezing my eyes shut, I tried not to be too embarrassed for myself. At least no one could see what came next. My <strong>[Transformation Sequence]</strong>. Even though they might hear it\u2026</p>\n<p>Choral music swelled, and I winced against the sudden noise and lights. It was way too loud\u2014it was going to wake someone up\u2014but I was committed now. Pink and cerulean lights flashed across me as I spun, my stuffed cat struggling in my hands. It leaped free and landed on the bed. My foot traced a wide circle onto the shag carpet as I pirouetted. My body glowed brighter and brighter, and I lifted off the ground. White thigh-high tights sprang up my legs, and matching gloves covered my hands and forearms.</p>\n<p>Then the dress replaced what pajamas remained.</p>\n<p>Poofy off-shoulder sleeves. A pink bow with a sapphire in the middle across my chest, with a little black loop around my neck. Two pink stripes running down the front. Then the skirts and petticoats\u2014blue, white, and fuschia layers, patterned with white laughing and crying mask buttons. Why did this always take so long? I had things to do!</p>\n<p>Pink ribbons tied themselves into my hair as a golden-white wand with a brilliant pink gem at its tip slapped into my left hand. Pink and blue stars jumped from finger to finger on my right hand before fading away. The song and dance were finally ending.</p>\n<p>My boots touched down on the carpet. When I opened my eyes and looked in the mirror, my pupils had gone star-shaped, and my hair was strawberry blonde. A fuschia-and-white domino mask sealed itself above my nose, completing the Costume. The music cut off, the flashing lights stopped, and everything quieted.</p>\n<p>Except for my mom\u2019s sleepy-sounding mumbles! \u201cAnnie\u2026Annie, what was <em>that</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>I froze. My heart pounded, and I swallowed nervously. If my mom walked in right now, it\u2019d be a disaster! \u201cOh, <strong>[Beep]</strong>,\u201d I whispered.</p>\n<p><strong> [Rating Warning #1! Episode Rating - PG! Censor in Effect]</strong></p>\n<p>Whoops!</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t fear Magical Girl Understudy is here I swear to defend the weak against evil and uphold truth and love,\u201d I whispered in a long, breathless string of words. Who\u2019d made this oath, anyways? Oh, right. Younger Annie. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Mom. I couldn\u2019t sleep, so I got on my tablet to watch a video or two. Go back to bed!\u201d</p>\n<p>Mom didn\u2019t say anything. I didn\u2019t mind. I needed a moment to think.</p>\n<p>I could untransform, but that\u2019d take time. If I wanted to stop Peter before he did something terrible, I didn\u2019t have time for two more <strong>[Transformation Sequences]</strong>! Not to mention finding a place to do them discreetly.</p>\n<p>Or\u2026</p>\n<p><em>&lt;You could try the window, Understudy. It</em><em>\u2019s what I\u2019d do, and you could be outside right meow!&gt;</em></p>\n<p>It\u2019d be faster, for sure. And I\u2019d be on my way to stopping Professor Panic.</p>\n<p>I made my choice\u2014the window it was. I popped it open and coughed. Wisps of smoke rolled into the room and through the gap under the door.</p>\n<p>Then I quickly pulled the screen off my bedroom window and stuck a leg through. I listened as Mom staggered down the hall, hacked a smoker\u2019s cough, and knocked on my door.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnnie, why does it smell like smoke in here? Are you smoking!? Come out here and talk to me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk in the morning, Mom. I\u2019m tired,\u201d I yawned, threw my other leg over the window frame, and dropped onto the dirt. Dusting off my dress, I picked myself up. Then I ran, weaving through her trailer park\u2019s twisting streets and sprinting toward the cottonwoods along the Winter River\u2019s banks.</p>\n<p>If Mom went back to bed, everything would be fine. Probably. And if not, I\u2019d get in trouble for sneaking out two days before I left for college. What was the worst that could happen? Grounding? Keeping me home from the mayor\u2019s speech? Taking away my phone? Peter could still talk to me without it. The phone just made things easier\u2014except when he texted me at one in the morning, the jerk!</p>\n<p>I had more important things to worry about anyways. I scratched Tails\u2019 neck, receiving an overly-loud purr as I caught my breath. The smokey smell filled my nostrils and stung my eyes. Whatever Professor Panic had planned, it probably had something to do with the fire. Which meant I needed to go faster.</p>\n<p>\u201c<strong>[Starwave Sail]</strong>,\u201d I shouted, spinning into the air. A translucent pastel sailboard shimmered under my feet, catching me before I could hit the ground and rocketing forward on a glowing pink and blue light trail. The sailboard raced along the river\u2019s bank toward a bright orange light downtown, sail flapping in the wind next to me. I leaned back, pushing the board\u2019s nose up, and windsurfed into the sky over Riverside. Tails sprinted along, her plushie body extending and compressing as her legs churned at the sky.</p>\n<p>The first chrome camera drone met me mid-air, humming along behind me. A moment later, a pack of blue-steel Panic Pal robots zipped by, playing the villain\u2019s stupid theme song as they gnashed their metal teeth and spun in the air. I turned to follow them toward the bank, my glowing trail lighting up the sky over Riverside with proof I was on my way!</p>\n<p><strong> [Showoff! +1 Flamboyance Point Pending]</strong></p>\n<p>The little message in my peripheral vision got me thinking. Was I close to a Flamboyance skill roll? I\u2019d finally filled out all six skills, so now I could roll an upgrade to one of my skills, a useful new skill for my build, or something that just\u2026sat in <strong>[Skill Storage] </strong>until the end of time. Flamboyance was also special because it was my <strong>[Signature Skill</strong><strong>\u2019s]</strong> style. I pulled up my Flamboyance Style point total.</p>\n<p>\u25ba<strong>Flamboyance</strong> (lvl 2; 45)</p>\n<p>I was! Maybe I\u2019d roll something that\u2019d finally let me use my <strong>[Signature Skill]</strong>. I\u2019d been sitting on <strong>[Adaptive Armoire]</strong> for a long time, but either Tails didn\u2019t know how it worked, or the stuffed animal wouldn\u2019t say. It didn\u2019t matter. If I played the Teen Heroine role right, I\u2019d have a new skill to roll by the Episode\u2019s end. Maybe even by the time Act One closed\u2014especially if I could force an early end by stopping Peter.</p>\n<p><em>Could</em> I force a Short, or would the System demand a full Episode? I\u2019d never tried it before.</p>\n<p>I closed my point total and returned to tracking the Panic Pal bots toward Carver Street.</p>\n<p>My hometown sprawled below me. The town\u2019s brick-and-wood main street ran straight beneath me, its restaurants and shops closed for the night. I recognized the pizza place that Peter had taken me to before prom. I\u2019d paid. He hadn\u2019t paid for a date since I realized who he <em>really</em> was. And where his money came from. A few seconds later, Riverside High\u2019s gravel track zipped by. I\u2019d never competed past sixth grade. It wouldn\u2019t have been fair.</p>\n<p>I only had eyes, though, for two sights.</p>\n<p>First, the bank. It was surrounded by fire trucks, police cruisers, and a crowd of bystanders\u2014Extras in the Episode, though they didn\u2019t know it yet. As I watched, the firefighters on a hose hustled away from the front door. A moment later, the faux-stone pillars collapsed, along with the roof, blocking it.</p>\n<p>The sailboard angled for the ground, disappearing as it touched down. I ran, sprinting to bleed off momentum, and skidded to a halt on the asphalt.</p>\n<p><strong> [Showoff! +1 Flamboyance Point Pending]</strong></p>\n<p>A firefighter ran up to me, screaming. \u201cThe bots grabbed people! They\u2019re still inside!</p>\n<p>A small part of me nodded and said my line the way I knew the audience wanted it. \u201cDon\u2019t fear; Magical Girl Understudy is here! I\u2019ll get them out. Just keep fighting it!\u201d</p>\n<p><strong> [Intense Line! +1 Drama Point Pending]</strong></p>\n<p>But the rest of my mind focused on the words I\u2019d seen while flying in.</p>\n<p>The message Peter had scorched into the grass outside the bank.

At least, that\u2019s what the floating box told me.</p>\n<p><strong>The prognosis for your long-term survival is vanishingly slim, </strong>the message read in bold, blocky letters. <strong>I suggest you come to terms with this reality and prepare yourself accordingly. If you happen to be a person of religious conviction, now would be an appropriate time to make amends with your preferred deity.</strong></p>\n<p>My eyes skipped frantically from word to word as I reread the prompt for the third time. I found myself staring slack-jawed at the partially transparent, off-yellow box, which looked almost like one of those eight-bit Nintendo Game notification prompts from the early eighties.</p>\n<p>A cold sweat broke out across my skin, and I momentarily pulled my gaze away from the prompt and looked down at the ground.</p>\n<p>I was in a wide hallway with short gray carpet\u2014the kind they use in hotels and office buildings\u2014and walls covered from floor to ceiling in stained yellow wallpaper, peeling in places and covered with water spots in others. That wallpaper was shoddy work and the whole place was badly in need of renovation. Blue-white lights ran along the ceiling, illuminating everything with a harsh, sterile glow that reminded me of an industrial warehouse or maybe a hospital.</p>\n<p>This couldn\u2019t be real. It didn\u2019t make sense. None of this made any sense.</p>\n<p>For the life of me, I couldn\u2019t figure out where I was, how I\u2019d gotten here, or what in the name of sweet baby Jesus was happening to me.</p>\n<p>Maybe I was going crazy.</p>\n<p>Or maybe I\u2019d died, and this was my own, personal version of hell.</p>\n<p>That was the most plausible option, all things considered.</p>\n<p>The last thing I remembered was from the night before.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d been at the bachelor party to end all bachelor parties with the rest of the guys from the general contracting crew. Joseph, <em>Joe-Dan</em>\u2014not to be confused with Joseph\u2014Zack, Jake, Dave, Cameron, Chad, and Niko, of course, since he was the lucky groom.</p>\n<p>There\u2019d been a stripper dressed as a clown for reasons I couldn\u2019t quite recall. Also fireworks. Well, maybe not fireworks <em>per se</em>, so much as sticks of Tannerite and a wee-little bit of Dynamite, which our buddy Jake had procured from a demo site in Dayton.</p>\n<p>I was pretty sure cow tipping had been involved at one point.</p>\n<p>I vividly recalled cannonballing off of my buddy Zack\u2019s roof and into an oversized kiddie pool filled with an unholy amalgamation of Natty Ice, Bud Lite, Corona, and whatever else the rest of the crew had lying around. Pretty sure Dave had dumped two or three boxes of Franzia red wine into the unspeakable alcohol concoction at one point.</p>\n<p>That probably explained why it felt like I\u2019d slept in a churning cement mixer filled with boulders and broken beer bottles. Leaping into kiddie pools full of booze was a young man\u2019s game, and I wasn\u2019t as young as I used to be. Not old exactly, but even at thirty-six, I found I didn\u2019t bounce back quite the way I had at twenty-six. The copious alcohol consumption also explained the raging hangover and dull ache radiating through my skull, pulsing steadily behind my eye sockets with every thump of my heart.</p>\n<p>But none of that gave me any insight, whatsoever, into where I was, how I\u2019d gotten here, or what in heaven above was happening. There was just a blank hole, big enough to drive an Abrams tank through, between the party and waking up in this barren stretch of industrial hallway.</p>\n<p>One minute I was laughing with Jake and Zack, telling old war stories about our time in the sandbox together, and the next I was peeling my ass off the gray carpet with the glare of harsh fluorescent lights stabbing into my eyeballs like an ice pick.</p>\n<p>The hallway dead-ended directly behind me and though there was a glaring red neon exit sign hanging from the ceiling, there wasn\u2019t a door to be seen. The hallway stretched onward for fifty feet or so, before letting out into a wide room with a series of white, square columns.</p>\n<p>Guttural, inhuman roars and the sharp <em>clang</em> of steel clashing against steel drifted toward me from the direction of the desolate conference room at the end of the corridor. This place might\u2019ve appeared barren, but it wasn\u2019t empty.</p>\n<p>Something was in here with me.</p>\n<p>Something dangerous.</p>\n<p>Which probably accounted for the ominous warning, tattooed on the air itself.</p>\n<p>Feeling the cold edge of panic creep into my chest, I turned my gaze back to the yellow box and reread the message once more, this time from the beginning.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Warning! Temporal Boundary Displacement Breach!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>As Standing Chair of the Variant Research Division, it is my responsibility to inform you that due to an unstable temporal anomaly\u2014and circumstances outside of VRD control\u2014you have accidentally experienced a temporal displacement event (TDE), sometimes referred to as \u201cNoclipping.\u201d</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Fortunately, you survived the event and have NOT been integrated into the Progenitor Engine or reduced to \u201cMeat Slurry\u201d by the Influx Processing and Randomization System.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Less fortunate, the prognosis for your long-term survival is vanishingly slim. I suggest you come to terms with this reality and prepare yourself accordingly. If you happen to be a person of religious conviction, now would be an appropriate time to make amends with your preferred deity.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u2014 The Researcher</strong></p>\n<p>Yep. None of that was even remotely helpful.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d never heard of the Variant Research Division, and I couldn\u2019t even begin to wrap my mind around what a temporal displacement event was. To me, the whole message was just a bunch of nonsense bullshit that sounded more or less like corporate speak for go fuck yourself.</p>\n<p>I squinted, examining the box itself a little more closely.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d been so panicked and shocked by the message that I\u2019d failed to notice there was a tiny \u201cX\u201d in the top right corner of the notification. I let my gaze linger on it for a beat and when I mentally \u201cclicked\u201d the button, the window blinked away. Gone in an instant as though it had never been there at all.</p>\n<p>Another thunderous boom rattled the floor, sending fine dust motes spinning and dancing through the air. A second later I heard an odd mewling noise followed in short order by the dull thump of footsteps<em> </em>and the <em>whoomph </em>of an explosion. Rolling tongues of flame flashed into view at the end of the hall before quickly dissipating.</p>\n<p>The sounds of battle were getting progressively closer, and it was impossible to miss the long shadows stretching across the carpeted floor.</p>\n<p>I glanced down and took stock of what I had to work with.</p>\n<p>I wasn\u2019t optimistic.</p>\n<p>Drunk me had made some <em>interesting </em>choices the night before. Choices that I was deeply, <em>deeply</em>, regretting right now.</p>\n<p>Slung around my shoulders and trailing down to my thighs was a knock-off red and gold, baroque Versace bathrobe. It was a hideous assault on taste and sensibility, and it actively made me despair for the future of humanity. I had never hated something so profoundly, or so quickly. Where it had come from or why on god\u2019s green Earth I was wearing it, were mysteries that beggared the imagination and defied all attempts at explanation.</p>\n<p>I had on a white wife-beater beneath the robe and a pair of Marine Corps issue green silkies, so short and tight they looked like cammo green daisy dukes sprayed painted onto my nethers. They were somehow both the <em>most</em> and <em>least</em> manly shorts that had ever been manufactured, and every single Marine\u2014current or former\u2014had at least one pair shoved in a dresser drawer because they were always mandatory attire for company and battalion formation runs.</p>\n<p>Instead of tennis shoes or flip flops, Drunk Me had opted for my clunky Red Wing work boots, which were missing the laces. Then, to complete the look, I\u2019d apparently decided to don my tool belt, which connected to a pair of leather suspenders that wrapped around my broad shoulders. Although I didn\u2019t have a mirror, I knew exactly how I must\u2019ve looked. Like a strung-out hobo who\u2019d managed to raid both a Home Depot and an upscale Department store during a city-wide blackout.</p>\n<p>Still, of all the terrible choices I\u2019d made last night, grabbing my work belt had been the best of the lot. I instinctively ran my hand over the various loops and pockets, fingers lightly touching each of the primary tools of my trade.</p>\n<p>Tape measure and multi-bit screwdriver. My 19oz rip claw hammer and the gray Stanley utility knife. On my other side was the beastly demolition screwdriver, capable of punching through damn near anything, and a steel, triangular speed square. Those were the big ones, though I had a host of lesser-used tools tucked away as well. Maglite, slip-lock pilers, cat\u2019s paw pry bar, torpedo level, and a small army of Sharpies and carpenter\u2019s pencils.</p>\n<p>Everything was present and accounted for.</p>\n<p>I wasn\u2019t sure how much good a 19oz claw hammer or a carpenter\u2019s pencil would be against whatever inhuman, flame-throwing horror was waiting for me at the end of the hallway. Not as much good as a Glock with a full mag, that was for damned sure, but it was still a shitload better than trying to go at it with bare knuckles and attitude.</p>\n<p>Though, truth be told, I was far better with a hammer or wrench in my hand than I\u2019d ever been with a rifle or a pistol. I\u2019d spent eight years in the Marine Corps, and though I\u2019d done a couple pumps overseas to combat zones scattered across the middle east\u2014Kuwait, Iraq, a short stint in Afghanistan\u2014I\u2019d served as Motor-T driver. I\u2019d spent most of my time behind the wheel of a troop carrier, pounding Rip Its and chain-smoking cigarettes, not kicking in doors or raiding insurgent stash houses.</p>\n<p>And that was the better part of ten years and thirty pounds ago. Other than the occasional hunting trip with the boys, I hadn\u2019t picked up a rifle or shotgun in ages.</p>\n<p>Steeling myself, I slipped on a pair of tan Mechanix work gloves, then pulled the hammer from its loop on my belt. If I was going to die, I\u2019d die fighting with a tool in my hands and a shit-eating grin on my face. Although I might\u2019ve left the door kicking to the hard chargers in the infantry, I didn\u2019t have any problem busting a few skulls if push came to shove.</p>\n<p>With my hammer clutched in one white-knuckled hand, I crept up to the edge of the hallway and pressed my body against the wall, heart thudding like a jackhammer.</p>\n<p>The hallway let out into an open, empty space with high ceilings that looked like it could\u2019ve been a generic conference room inside any of a thousand rundown hotels across America. The walls were plastered with more of the nondescript yellow wallpaper and the white columns rose to a drab white tiled ceiling which was dotted with more recessed, flat panel lights. The flickering florescent bulbs cast pools of jagged illumination and oceans of darkness across the carpeted floor.</p>\n<p>There was no furniture. No end tables or cheap wing-backed chairs. No reception desk or receiving area. Just an enormous, abandoned cavern of gray carpet and wallpaper, which reminded me of a yawning mouth.</p>\n<p>I counted four more hallways that branched off from the main room, and three sets of wooden double doors, which presumably let out into more hallways still. There wasn\u2019t any signage indicating where any of these various hallways went.</p>\n<p>This place was a modern-day, corporate labyrinth.</p>\n<p>But I was a little less worried about the lack of signage and potential building code violations, and a little more worried about the amorphous, oozing blob of red tentacles rushing toward me from one of the hallways on the left\u2026</p>\n            </div>",

        "chapter_content": "<div class=\"chapter-inner chapter-content\">\n                <p>Sarah wished she was sick. She could still get sick. Stick her fingers down her throat, maybe. But she'd already had breakfast, and the granola would probably hurt coming back up. She'd already said good morning to Mom, so it was too late to have a sore throat and a cough. Fevers were impossible to fake without real planning. And she'd stayed home with cramps last week, so that wasn't really an option. She certainly wasn't going to offer up any symptoms more vague than that, not again.</p>\n<p>Today would have been a great day to lay on the floor and watch dust motes in the sun. Maybe watch some game shows with the sound off, curled on the couch under a pile of blankets. Heat up a can of Spaghetti-Os for lunch. If she was really lucky there'd be some movie marathon on. That just sounded divine. It's not like she was behind on any schoolwork anyways. Other than biology, it wasn't like going to class was going to help at all with that.</p>\n<p>The fog was bad today, and thick fog always meant she was about to have a worse day than usual. Some days she could get up and everything looked clear, but this morning the white film seemed to coat everything she could see, somehow making the little reflections in the kitchen brighter and making the milk in her cereal seem to glow as she dipped her spoon into it. She could hear music thumping as someone started their car down the street, the energetic beat carrying over the sounds of the engine. The passing beat almost lined up with her own heartbeat echoing in her ears. She carefully cleared her dishes, putting the bowl and spoon gently in the dishwasher before slowly closing the door.</p>\n<p>It was definitely bad today, even the water in the faucet was loud. Washing her hands almost felt painful under the spray of water. At least brushing her teeth was a release - she could focus entirely on the sensations of the bristles over her gums, the scritching sounds filling her head, and the taste of mint flooding out the noises outside. But soon enough she had to spit, flinch at the cold water rinsing over her teeth, and finish up. No time to brush her hair, so she just gathered it up into a ponytail, pulling the worst of the frizz tight against her head.</p>\n<p>Finishing in the bathroom, she made her way back to her room. Her walls were painted a faded greenish blue, her mother called the color something fancy, and it matched the darker carpet. Sarah wished she could have something different, this carpet always showed her footprints standing out in a pale contrast to the dark olive green. She'd have to vacuum again tonight, or the footprints would keep her up. Her bed was already made, the cotton beige comforter pulled tight and her pillow squared up on top. She turned around to grab a hoodie from her closet. Even in October, the days were plenty hot, but sometimes the hood helped. It stuck on a hanger for a moment, but she just tugged a bit harder until it popped out. She was just pulling it on over her head when her bedroom door crashed open, her mother looming into view.</p>\n<p>Sarah couldn't help but scream, just a little. Her mother jumped too, startled by the noise. \"Are you ready?\" She asked, \"I've got to get going, or I'll be late.\" <br><br>\"Just packing,\" said Sarah. Her backpack already had her school stuff in it, but she took a moment to double-check. She pulled a novel from the shelf over her desk, she was pretty close to finishing the one that was already in there, and she couldn't remember if her locker had anything in it. Some earplugs got stuffed into a side pocket - she couldn't usually get away with them in class, but if things were still rough by lunch she'd need them there. Sarah glanced around, but at this point, she was just looking for reasons to stall. No excuse loomed from the bare walls or tidy shelves.</p>\n<p>Her backpack was heavy, but it felt good pressing down on her back.</p>\n<p>As she trudged out of the house and sat in the car, her mom asked, \"Are you ok?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm fine.\"</p>\n<p>\"Your head isn't bothering you? No, um, migraine?\"</p>\n<p>Her mom wasn't looking at her, so Sarah couldn't just nod, \"I'm fine.\" She could have said yes, but she'd done that before, and that would be worse than just going to school.</p>\n<p>The car ride wasn't too bad. Sarah could keep her eyes closed, which always helped. The car was just a Toyota, but it ran smooth and they'd had it long enough that it didn't smell funny or anything. Even better, the city had repaved the highway last summer, so the motion of the car actually felt soothing instead of the normal bouncing and jarring. And while she couldn't call David Sedaris soothing, public radio in the morning was still about as good a soundscape as anyone could hope for.</p>\n<p>And then came the moment of truth. The little Camry pulled to the curb outside school, and when the door opened Sarah found herself bathed in shouting, discordant voices. A basketball was being dribbled. Tinny screeches could be heard from at least four sets of earphones. They were kind of early, and the marching band was out behind the school doing something brassy and stompy. Skateboard wheels clattered by over the asphalt. The rope and chains on the flagpole swung in the morning breeze, ringing against the steel flagpole.</p>\n<p>Thank god she didn't have to ride the school bus. One of the busses was roaring to a stop around the corner, and she could hear the thump of unbalanced tires completely failing to cover up the echoes of voices inside as it stopped. The hiss of the door opening up released those voices to waft over her.</p>\n<p>Sarah stood, frozen. The fog was brighter too, almost like something was shining a light on everything from no particular direction. Finally, a voice pierced through, someone had said her name. Sarah turned back to her mom, smiled, and said, \"I love you too. See you later.\"</p>\n<p>With that, she squared up and dove into the school.</p>\n<div>\n<p>Inside was strangely better. She was still assaulted by voices and voices and voices, and now they were accompanied by squeaking shoes that cut through the noise. Lockers slamming shut gave a baseline to the piercing noises. But the light wasn't so bad inside; other than the row of doors at the entrance, there weren't any windows in the hallway to let the morning sun bounce reflections into her eyes. The walls and doors did a decent job filtering out the engine noises from outside, too.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Sarah felt like it would be best if she got out of the hallways before they got truly crowded. A trio of senior girls she only knew by sight shot past her on their way outside. The girl in front yelled as she ran by, \"Hey Sarah.\"</p>\n<p>Sarah gave a little wave, turning around as they ran past, but the three were out the doors before she could hardly begin the motion. No big deal, really. Sarah didn't know any of their names anyways. She reversed her turn, rather than spin in a full circle like a leaf in the wind of the older girls' passing. Sarah's mood lifted for a moment, as she imagined herself spinning like a top as people passed her in the hallways. She wasn't sure what a dervish was - but she'd had a ballerina phase way back before the fog started glowing around everything. She'd missed a year or so after she'd told her parents about what she could see, and never got back to it. But a little part of her still liked the thought of just spinning for the joy of it.</p>\n<p>Another kid, Jacob maybe? Josh? A 'J' name, for sure. He came in, walking past her as she stood imagining dancing in the halls. He was wearing a big pair of over-ear headphones with the cord tucked into his shirt, a good enough pair that she couldn't hear the music he was listening to. But she could still hear him mumbling to himself, \"How low, before I get in, before I mmmm mmm, before I begin, how low before...\"</p>\n<p>He brought her attention right back to the hallway, and she shuddered as she got moving. It was Tuesday, so pre-calc was her first period class. That was always a relief. Coach Colway was boring to the point of caricature. He was a golf coach, of all things, but he taught math too. She wasn't really sure if he'd started teaching first and became a coach later, or if he'd been a coach first. But more importantly, his classroom was practically empty. No posters, no doodads waving from the walls; he was strict too, no music, very little talking. He'd just drone a bit, do an example problem or two on the whiteboard, and then pass out worksheets and let them all get to it.</p>\n<p>Sarah was the first person in the room. Coach wasn't there, but his room was unlocked and so she let herself in. Sarah grabbed a seat in the middle of the room. her shoulders shook as she took off her backpack. She set it on the desk, then quickly sat down into the seat. She pulled out yesterday's novel and opened it up, focusing as much attention as she could manage on the way the fictional hero helped the British storm a mountainous fort in old India. It was a good book, and she felt outraged on the soldier's behalf at his treatment by the villains of the story, but she still noticed when Coach came in. He was making a sort of slithery noise as he shuffled a stack of printer paper in his hands.</p>\n<p>The first bell rang, announcing that there were only 8 minutes to get to class, and Sarah had to fight with herself to not cover her ears. Instead, she just hunched down a bit deeper in her seat.</p>\n<p>The trickle of students walking in didn't help her concentration either. More sneaker squeaking, loud conversations continued as pairs came together, friends getting caught up on whatever they'd missed from each other's lives since yesterday. Sarah smiled, trying to look up whenever someone said good morning or hi or whatever. She'd say hello back, wave, whatever seemed appropriate, and then turn back to her book.</p>\n<p>The second bell rang, the muscles in Sarah's neck tensed up and her book bent under her grip as she waited out the shrill noise. Her hands relaxed, but her neck stayed rigid as the morning announcements continued. Nothing special, a volleyball match that everyone was supposed to care about. The student council voice on the intercom somehow felt just as shrill as the bell had, but at least most of the conversations had stopped.</p>\n<p>Coach Colway was standing up before announcements even finished, writing on the board. More sequences, it looked like. That shouldn't be very difficult, even if he was writing some letter-filled formula up next to the numbers. This was probably the last new thing they'd cover in the week because there was a test scheduled for Friday and Colway usually spent a day or two letting people review. Sarah dutifully put her book away, stuffing it into her bag's front pocket. She rummaged in the main space for a moment, finding the right spiral notebook and dragging it out. The wires had already mushed down, so she had to force it open to a blank page where she could start copying the problems he wrote out.</p>\n<p>Coach growled, \"Quiet,\" as a whispered conversation tried to revive in the back, and Sarah finally felt herself start to relax a bit. She didn't even notice the faint mist overlaying everything in the room.</p>\n<p>Then the bell rang again, catching her entirely by surprise. Her lead broke as she forced her pencil hard against the paper, dragging a short dark line across the problem she'd been working on. The math hadn't been hard, it was just another way of rewriting equations in different forms, but there was something satisfying about rearranging the numbers like a little puzzle.</p>\n<p>She packed up again, folding up the worksheet and closing her notebook around it, then shoving the whole thing back into her bag.</p>\n<p>Now the hallways were truly crowded. It simply wasn't possible to move through them without bumping into other kids. Lockers, shoes, talking, it all filled her ears like a physical force. She looked both ways, considering. She could go to the bathroom, and the hallways would empty out in a few minutes, but then she'd probably be late to biology. Bio was already bad enough, she wasn't sure if she wanted to risk drawing Mrs. Bianchi's attention even more. No, she'd just grit her teeth and go. If she was fast enough she could maybe even get a seat by the door, away from the windows.</p>\n<p>She set her shoulders and began pushing through. She moved fast enough to earn a few shouts of surprise and irritation when she'd misgauged a space and knock shoulders a bit too hard. Sometimes it'd be some senior or otherwise solid guy and she'd just sort of bounce off them instead. Despite being about to turn eighteen in just eight months, she was still small enough to be routinely mistaken for a freshman. A small freshman who wouldn't even make a jock stumble when she crashed into them. Regardless of the contact, she kept her head down and moved quickly enough to not see anyone's reaction or to even really register who she'd bumped into. It didn't help that the Bio room was about as far as was possible from Algebra without one of them being outside in the portables.</p>\n<p>After what felt like a marathon, she reached the door. It was shut, and some cartooney poster featuring a tree with a face blocked off the little window in it. She pulled it open and stumbled in, but was forced to suddenly stop her rush by the bright sunlight that filled the room. Between the half dozen dirty skylights, two walls filled with windows, and banks of grow lights that never turned off, the room was absolutely blinding after the dim hallways.</p>\n<p>Sarah was forced to close her eyes, standing in the doorway as she tried to adjust. Even with her eyes closed, she could see the outlines of everything burnt into her eyelids. Fuzzy green filled the windows, where racks of plants grew, filling the room with a cloying and musty aroma. Instead of the little boxy desks with built-in chairs, this room had tall, heavy tables lined with stools. The bright glow in the room was strong enough that she almost didn't notice the music. Some classical something tinkling away, each note interrupting her thoughts.</p>\n<div>\n<p>Mrs. Bianchi was walking along the tables, passing out a piece of paper to the students already in the room. It looked like she'd have to either sit right in front or at one of the tables along the wall. She already knew the wall would be better. It wasn't pleasant, sitting where the floral aromas were strongest, and where the sun shone directly on her, but it wasn't as though anywhere in that room was particularly quiet. Better to endure a lot of discomfort than to be right where Mrs. Bianchi would see her not focusing on the work.</p>\n<p>She was sitting down and pulling out another notebook when the bell rang. She was startled enough that she dropped her whole bag, spilling it onto the ground. With a groan, Sarah dropped out of her stool to start gathering the papers and books. The girl sitting next to her got down to help.</p>\n<p>\"Don't use your locker?\" asked the girl.</p>\n<p>Sarah didn't say anything, just kept looking down as she shoved more into her bag.</p>\n<p>\"I never do either,\" said the other girl, handing over the last few pages.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you,\" mumbled Sarah.</p>\n<p>\"No problem,\" whispered the girl, because Mrs. Bianchi had started talking. Sarah finally risked a glance up at her neighbor, realizing that this is one of the girls who had half-spun her that morning. She smiled, noticing that the junior was wearing dangly earrings shaped like leaves. That was probably where she'd gotten the mental image from. For just a moment, the girl looked green. Not ill, but like her whole body shifted shades for a moment. Sarah blinked, and everything was back to the misty white that filled the room.</p>\n<p>Sarah jumped again, as half the class shouted \"Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell!\"</p>\n<p>Mrs. Bianchi laughed along, then continued, \"But I suppose we need to talk about why. Mitochondria make a protein called ATP, which in turn is the fuel, the gasoline, for the cell...\"</p>\n<p>Mrs. Bianchi continued along, but the reflection of a windshield of a passing car made Sarah blink some tears away. And by the time she could struggle back through the screeching violin that bounced around the room, the teacher had gotten far enough along that Sarah was totally lost. She dutifully took what notes she could, writing about stairs and chains and phosphor-something or other. She could have paid more attention, but Sarah was more focused on controlling twitches and grimaces every time the music changed, or a bit of light moved, or someone got too enthusiastic about a bad joke from the teacher.</p>\n<p>Disgustingly enough, the only thing that kept Sarah even slightly under control was the posters and diagrams around the room. They were still busy, but she could read the labels on a couple of the closer ones, and she could digest them in between distractions. Sarah figured that memorizing the bones in a skeleton or the stages of the decomposition cycle were biology related, even if she was going to have to sit down with the textbook alone to have any hope of understanding the day's lesson.</p>\n<p>After about half an hour, Mrs. Bianchi had them all turn to the worksheet she'd passed out. It was another diagram, filled with blanks, and they were expected to fill it out, demonstrating that they'd learned from the lecture. And then Mrs. Bianchi turned the volume of the music up even louder. Sarah sat, her hands in her lap, and stared at the page. There were no stairs, nor anything that looked like stairs. Lots of circles though, lots of poorly-photocopied circles. And lines, lines where she was supposed to write stuff down.</p>\n<p>Sarah jumped yet again, this time because the girl next to her had pushed her, gently, on her shoulder. Sarah focused back at her, looking at the other girl's mouth.</p>\n<p>\"I said, do you want to do this together?\" she asked. \"I mean, I took notes, and I think I've got it, but I still remember Tyson complaining about this class. He got a four on the test, but still only got a C in the class.\"</p>\n<p>\"What?\" asked Sarah. She still wasn't quite tracking, percussive notes filling her ears.</p>\n<p>\"Sorry, my brother, Tyson,\" she said. \"He's way smart, but never got bad grades. But he complained about AP Bio all the time. I think I've got this, but we should still do it together.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh,\" said Sarah. She stood up abruptly, dropping down from the stool. \"I'm sorry, I've got to, I've got,\" she said as she darted away.</p>\n<p>Sarah went up to Mrs. Bianchi's desk, \"Ma'am, can I have a hall pass? I need to go to the bathroom.\"</p>\n<p>Mrs. Bianchi just smiled, and said, \"Of course,\" before handing Sarah a large plush frog. The frog was wearing a t-shirt that said \"Hall Pass\" in big blue letters.</p>\n<p>Sarah left the classroom as fast as she could, but she didn't turn right toward the nearest bathroom. Instead, she turned left, leaving the building, heading towards the football field. On the home team side, there was a dingy brick building under the stadium. Part of it was dominated by a big steel shutter that closed over a counter where Costco soda and candy got sold during games. But off to the side were bathrooms. She ducked into the girls' restroom and found herself in a dingy but surprisingly clean bathroom. This time of year, girls sports were all indoors, so really only the boys practiced out here, and there hadn't been any games for long enough that the place had probably seen more janitors than girls lately.</p>\n<p>More importantly, it was dark, empty, and quiet.</p>\n<p>She found a stall and sat down, feeling the muscles in her back loosen up. She couldn't stay long, at the very least she'd have to return the frog, but for a few minutes, she had some refuge. After a few minutes in the warm bathroom, Sarah could feel her breath start coming easier as her heartbeat slowed. She felt achy all over, but without the good fuzzy feelings she had after a hard workout. She could hear voices getting louder outside - all male voices. Second period must be almost over, and the guys' PE class was heading back to their locker room so they could change. And to not shower. She needed to get moving too.</p>\n<div>\n<p>Walking slowly now, she went back inside to the bio classroom. The cartoon tree felt like it was sneering at her, his big white eyes shimmering as sunlight bled through. With a deep breath, she opened the door. She didn't pause even as the light briefly dazzled her, just dropped the plush hall pass on the teacher's desk and trudged back to her table, ready to wait a few minutes until the next bell.</p>\n<p>Her backpack and notebook were where she'd left them, although she noticed her pencil had been slid into the wire binding of the spiral notebook. Her table was empty now, the senior girl who'd been sitting there was up and chatting with friends across the room.</p>\n<p>She pulled her bag up onto the table to get ready to leave, and Sarah noticed that her notebook had been drawn on. There were goofy little anime faces doodled in the corners of the page, a girl with a ridiculously ornate updo and a boy with giant eyes that bulged above his spiky hair. A third face was half finished, with just the outline of a chin and ears framing an empty space. Sarah couldn't take her eyes away, so distracted she missed the end of Mrs. Bianchi's playlist as a tinkling harpsichord petered into silence. She shook her head and picked up her notebook to put it away, and noticed more on the page behind.</p>\n<p>Someone, that upperclassman, she guessed, had drawn out the same diagram from the worksheet, with all the labels filled out in ridiculously cutesy handwriting. She'd even dotted the eyes with little loopy spirals and put smiley faces inside of some of the bigger letters. Looking at the page, her hand twitched, tugging on the corner, ready to pull the page out of its wire bindings to crumple and leave.</p>\n<p>Sarah didn't need help. She had her textbook, she could have gotten it done on her own. How dare that girl write in someone else's notes? Did she think that Sarah was dumb? That Sarah had some learning disability? Sarah was the smartest kid in that class, it wasn't her fault that Mrs. Bianchi insisted on making the room as painful as possible. Her face felt like a mask, she could hear the girl giggling behind her, oblivious like everyone. Sarah wanted to spin, to throw the book at her. No, she wanted to throw it at Mrs. Bianchi. A shift in light drew her attention to the plants on the wall, and Sarah took a step towards them, reaching out.</p>\n<p>She almost picked up one of the pots, but at the last moment, she shifted and satisfied herself by just plucking a single leaf off. She sat back on the stool and slowly tore it into little bits, staining her fingers with a muddy green as she did so. A powerful odor rose up as she did, making her feel like she should retch. She glanced back at the pot she'd almost attacked - it had a tag with big loopy letters that said, \"Basil.\"</p>\n<p>Of course, thought Sarah, of course, the bio plants are even worse when you break them.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, I do love that,\" a voice behind her boomed. Mrs. Bianchi had walked up without Sarah noticing. \"Sometimes when I'm stressed I do the same thing. The herby smells are just wonderful, aren't they?\"</p>\n<p>Sarah didn't answer, so Mrs. Bianchi continued, \"I just wanted to let you know that you don't need to hand in today's worksheet. Keep it to study from, I know a lot of you kids would rather memorize anyways, and frankly, your book doesn't do a great job laying this out. You'll need to know it for the AP test at the end of the year.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thank you,\" said Sarah.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, and I asked Alexa to copy it out for you. A lot of people mix up where the phosphates go.\"</p>\n<p>Hearing her name, the girl who'd been sitting next to Sarah looked over and waved briefly, before going back to whatever gossip was keeping them so entertained.</p>\n<p>At that, the bell rang, making Sarah jump again. This time she couldn't help but cover her ears. The next few periods were easy enough. Third was computer science. The whole room was dark and bare, with just the chairs and computers filling it. Sarah dimmed the screen where she was sitting, and even better she got to put in headphones. She quickly found a white noise generator and turned it on, filtering out what little chatter filled the room. That hour passed quickly.</p>\n<p>Fourth period was PE. It was plenty loud, and she absolutely hated Coach Wilkin's whistle, but she was allowed to jog the track instead of participating in whatever inane game was on the schedule today. The exertion and rhythmic feel of her feet hitting the rubberized track wasn't exactly fun, but she could get into a groove of sorts that let all the other stuff slide away.</p>\n<p>Despite zoning out, she noticed when Coach Wilkin dismissed them back to the locker room. The shrill whistle helped. Sarah grabbed a shower stall and quickly rinsed the sweat off, holding her hair out of the water with one hand. The spray stung her skin, but after the run, she almost didn't mind the laughing and talking echoing around the tile room. She didn't really pay attention to it, but the locker room had more of the misty fog in it than most rooms like it did. For the most part, she associated the fog with noise, light, movement, and lots of stuff.</p>\n<p>The locker room was just tile, with aluminum benches and big lockers. It spent most of its time empty, and people weren't usually all that energetic. The girls mostly were stalling and dragging their feet when they changed into their gym clothes. After an hour being worked by Coach Wilkins (a four-foot, eleven-inch ex-cheerleader who still possessed all the irritating competitive optimism of the stereotype), the girls were mostly too subdued and tired out to be very active when changing back out of those gym clothes.</p>\n<p>Shower done, she shucked her shower sandals into the mesh bag with her sweaty t-shirt and shorts, stuffing them into a locker. No PE on Wednesday, so she'd wear them on Thurs and then take the bag home to wash. Sarah momentarily felt irritated that there wasn't a PE class offered last period of the day. But all things considered, it was probably best to let boys have that slot anyways. Too many of them smelled bad enough already, so any boy who waited till the end of the day to get smelly was a good thing.</p>\n<p>Although fourth wasn't all bad. It was just lunch next, so she didn't have to rush getting dressed. It wasn't as though she did anything fancy with her hair and makeup anyways. A few brushes to make sure things were straight before pulling the elastic around her ponytail were plenty. And the closest she ever got to makeup was if she grabbed unusually shiny chapstick.</p>\n<div>\n<p>Of course, there was simply no way Sarah would even consider subjecting herself to the cafeteria. The mere thought made her hands shake, just a little. Not even on a good day was that place tolerable. The other people didn't even pretend to keep quiet, and there'd always be a few playing music from tinny little speakers. Plus the smell of chili, or cheap pizza, or whatever crud was on the menu would stick to her hair all day long. No, there was absolutely no reason to go into that big room. Even if she'd forgotten to make a sack lunch, she'd be better off just being a bit hungry.</p>\n<p>No, she had something better she could do. Instead of the lunch hall, Sarah made her way to Mr. Clarke's art room. He always left it open during lunch - he said it was so people could work on stuff, but Sarah suspected he'd already lost his keys this year. There was a rumor that a few years back he'd given everyone in all of his classes an A after losing his laptop with all his grades. Whatever the reason, she had her advanced art class right after lunch, so she had every excuse to be there. Even better, Mr. Clarke didn't care about food or drink in the room. It made sense, it was unlikely that spilled soda or dripped bbq sauce or whatever would ever be worse than the damage that paint splatters, lumps of resin, and various adhesives had already done.</p>\n<p>The art room was almost as bright as bio, but so far it had always felt more tolerable to Sarah. Maybe it was because she was usually in there during midday, and even though it had just as many big windows the sun wasn't shining directly into the classroom. It might also have been simply that the room was usually quiet. It was tucked on the side of the school, away from both the main road and the gym and football field. Even when it was full of students, it remained fairly quiet as everyone tended to just focus on their projects.</p>\n<p>This semester they were supposed to do some sort of sculpture. Sarah got hers down, bringing it to the table she usually worked at. At the moment, she just had ten oblong lumps of clay about the size of her thumb. They were laid out on a board, and she'd spread a plastic bag to keep it from drying completely out.</p>\n<p>She eyed them for a moment, considering getting right to work with them, but a growl from her stomach reminded her what time it actually was. Sarah got back into her backpack, rummaging around to where her food had fallen to the bottom. Miraculously, her sandwich only had one corner smooshed, although her apple was pretty thoroughly bruised. That was ok, it just made the apple a bit more juicy, and Mr. Clarke kept plenty of paper towels around. And the sandwich was just peanut butter on wheat bread. It was hard to hurt that.</p>\n<p>She pulled out her novel to read as she ate. She was actually able to focus on it and lose herself in the pages. A bloody charge against a fort's wall, the outer fort taken thanks to a breach opened by artillery. The main fort was apparently impregnable until the hero found an undefended corner that could be climbed. More fighting, then the enemy commander was killed shortly after the hero's servant boy was killed.</p>\n<p>The hero had just managed to find his real enemy, a particularly vile British sergeant, when the door to Mr. Clarke's room suddenly banged open as a tall redheaded boy burst into the room.</p>\n<p>Sarah didn't really like Finn. He was one of those boys who had an adult build at fourteen. Tall, broad, athletic, pretty much the only thing that he ever got teased about was his red hair. And even was more ironic than mean, what with people chanting \"Ginger\" at football games whenever he ran the ball. Not that Sarah had ever been to the games, but they'd chant just the same during the couple of pep assemblies she hadn't managed to get out of.</p>\n<p>\"Sarita Bonita!\" he called out as soon as he saw her. He thought that nickname was funny.</p>\n<p>Sarah just ignored him, setting her book down and uncovering her project. She was planning on making butterflies, with glazed clay bodies and stained glass wings. The bodies had already been given a rough shape and then left to dry out just enough that she could carve the clay instead of just smooshing it around with her fingers. She turned her back to them, and to Finn, to get some carving tools from the back wall.</p>\n<p>When she turned around again, she saw Finn at her table, holding up one of the little bodies in his big hands.</p>\n<p>\"What are you working on?\" he asked her, smiling. \"Surely it's not some artsy poop thing?\"</p>\n<p>\"No,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"Well, what then? You're not going to make a Madonna or something to lay them on, are you?\" he laughed to himself.</p>\n<p>\"Put it down, please,\" asked Sarah.</p>\n<p>\"I mean, Mr. Clarke's laid back, but I don't think he'd really like something quite so, um, provocateur.\"</p>\n<p>\"Give it back, Finn,\" said Sarah, her voice starting to tighten up.</p>\n<p>\"No worries, Sarita,\" he answered. He set the oblong lump of clay back on the board before wiping his hand on the front of his jeans, leaving a smear of reddish clay on his thigh.</p>\n<p>Sarah tried to ignore him as he left her table to get his own stuff out. He'd shaped some wire mesh into a pointy oval cylinder and had a pile of paper strips piled up. His creativity apparently stretched far enough to make a paper mache football. He actually came and set down right next to her. Not looking at him, she picked up one of her butterflies and started to carve it out, making the eyes a bit more recognizable, emphasizing the segments in the insect's body.</p>\n<p>She was just carving out two long grooves for the wings when Finn spoke up again, \"Are you using the book too? For your project?\"</p>\n<p>Sarah realized that he hadn't been doing anything with his project, he'd just been watching her. He was close enough that Sarah couldn't really pretend to have not heard him. \"No,\" she said.</p>\n<p>Finn picked up the book, \"Oh, is it any good? Do you think I'd like it?\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't know,\" she said in a quiet monotone. Sarah had to stop carving, her hands were starting to shiver, just a bit.</p>\n<p>\"So what's it about?\"</p>\n<p>\"Just put it down.\"</p>\n<p>\"I will,\" he said, thumbing it open and starting to read the first few pages.</p>\n<p>Sarah suddenly twitched, breaking the piece of clay she'd been holding. Even though it hadn't been fired, it was still dry enough that it cracked apart like dried mud, the crumbled lumps of clay falling down onto the table. She spun at Finn, not really knowing what she was about to do. Shout at him, or probably just talk really fast at him. She wasn't about to start crying in frustration, no matter what else happened. Maybe she'd reach out and grab her book back, hopefully without bending it too much. Ideally, she could explain that she really didn't want to talk to him, or to anyone. She just wanted to work, she just wanted her stuff back, she wanted her butterfly to not be broken, and she wanted her project to turn out pretty, and suddenly she froze.</p>\n<p>The white mist, the fog that had surrounded everything since she was nine, suddenly flashed a bright yellow. Everything shone yellow through the mist. All her life, the fog hadn't ever done anything that she'd ever seen. It didn't even make it harder to see things at a distance, it had never moved, never flowed with the breeze, but now it changed. Sarah forgot about Finn and her book, stunned by the change.</p>\n<p>And then she felt the burning, a hot fizzing on her skin. It was worse around her face - her ears, mouth, and eyes were spikes of pain driving toward her brain. She tried to scream, but instead, Finn just saw her eyes roll back before she collapsed on the ground, twitching.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n            </div>",

We really shouldn\u2019t have done this. No one who targets Zenith lives another day!\u201d Arthur whispered. Arthur had always been a man of caution, his thin frame, buttoned up shirt, and round glasses were typical of a guy who spent most of his life behind computer screens.</p>\n<p>\"Ah, Arthur,\" Damian responded, an edge of thrill in his tone, \"This will be our greatest heist of all time. Once we secure 'it', our lives will never be the same.\"</p>\n<p>Damian had always been a risk-taker, a dreamer. His dream was the Nova Recognition, the highest global honor that few in the field of science and engineering had managed to achieve. It was more than a simple medal, winning the Nova guaranteed your name to be written down in history, the respect and fame gained was a plus in Damian\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>\"We just need to stick to the plan, Arthur,\" Damian reassured, ignoring the fear etched on his friend's face.</p>\n<p>\u201cOver here!\u201d</p>\n<p>Suddenly, Damian's hand shot out, pulling Arthur into a shadowy corner. Footsteps echoed and grew louder. The two men held their breath, hearts pounding like drums in their chests. The guards, their heavy boots thudding against the metallic floors, passed by, their voices fading into the distance.</p>\n<p>Silently, they stepped out of the shadows, a bead of sweat rolling down Arthur's forehead. Damian wiped it off, his smirk never faltering.</p>\n<p>\"See? That was easy. And it's only going to get easier, trust me,\" Damian said, his fingers tracing over the blueprint - a comprehensive plan, months in the making, just to secure his target.</p>\n<p>Phase one had been 'Infiltration'. Damian had spent months studying Zenith Corp's patterns - the shift changes, the rotation of guards, the frequency of the various system checks. Damian didn\u2019t know anyone better than Arthur who could create fake ID cards so they decided to enter the facility by posing as technicians for a routine maintenance inspection, an idea Damian thought of after noticing the slight laxity during shift changes.</p>\n<p>The second phase, 'Navigation', was where Arthur shone. Arthur had used his expert hacking skills to get a copy of Zenith's blueprints. The twisting maze of the facility's hallways, labs, and offices was etched into their minds. They knew where to go, which paths were less patrolled, and where their target was kept.</p>\n<p>Phase three, 'Diversion', was the trickiest. They had planted miniature, battery-powered devices around the facility. These gadgets were timed to create system malfunctions across the facility, drawing the guards and staff away from their path and their target.</p>\n<p>The fourth and final phase, 'Extraction', hinged on a daring exit through the labyrinth of underground tunnels that ran beneath Zenith Corp. Damian knew these were mostly used for discreet transportation of delicate tech, and were relatively lightly guarded.</p>\n<p>And at the heart of all this was the mysterious 'it', their ultimate goal. It was kept under the tightest security, in the core of Zenith Corp.</p>\n<p>\"Damian, you know how I feel about your plans,\" Arthur replied, hesitating. \"Remember the fiasco at Cygnet Tech?\"</p>\n<p>Cygnet Tech had been their first major target, a growing star in the field of robotics. It was a different time back then. Damian's dreams were young, his plans haphazard and Arthur, swept up in his friend\u2019s excitement, had eagerly followed along.</p>\n<p>Their aim was to snatch Cygnet Tech's prized invention, a self-learning AI module, known as the 'Phoenix Core'. Damian believed that this core held the key to some revolutionary theories he had been working on. It was their first taste of the corporate underbelly, and they had been woefully unprepared.</p>\n<p>On the night of the heist, everything that could go wrong, did go wrong. Damian's 'foolproof' plan had crumbled at the first obstacle. They tripped the alarms within the first twenty minutes so they had to retreat but their getaway van broke down, and they had to escape on foot whilst being chased by Cygnet's security. Damian still wondered how they managed to get out of there alive.</p>\n<p>\"This is different, Arthur,\" Damian insisted, his eyes never leaving the blueprint. \"It's Zenith Corp, not Cygnet Tech. And 'it' is the prize. The Nova is waiting for me.\"</p>\n<p>They slowly made their way towards the final room, their hearts pounding in unison. Hiding behind a pillar, Damian counted 4 guards standing like stone statues. They wore black suits and had stern faces, their hands rested on the cold grip of their guns.</p>\n<p>Damian reached into his pocket, pulling out a small remote. With a simple press of a button, the tiny, battery-powered devices scattered around the facility sprung to life. The devices set off alarms in various sectors, sparking chaos throughout Zenith Corp.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis way!\u201d Like a swarm of bees disturbed from their hive, the guards sprang into action, their radios crackling with urgent orders. One by one, they rushed away, leaving behind a single guard. He stood tensed, his hand holding his gun firmly as he looked around.</p>\n<p>\"Arthur,\" Damian whispered, his hand holding out a pair of sound-cancelling earbuds. Arthur took them, his face pale. He wasn't a fan of what was to come. As they both placed the earbuds in, Damian activated a high-frequency sound wave from another device.</p>\n<p>The guard clutched his head in pain, his face contorted in agony. He dropped to his knees, his gun clattering on the floor. Seizing the moment, Damian rushed forward, delivering a swift chop to the back of the guard's neck. The man slumped down to the floor, knocked out cold.</p>\n<p>\"Damian,\" Arthur grimaced, looking at the unconscious guard. \"That was...\"</p>\n<p>\"Needed,\" Damian cut him off, his face serious. \"Remember, it's us or them.\"</p>\n<p>Nodding slowly, Arthur pulled out the forged ID cards from his pocket. With a deep breath, he scanned them at the door. A moment later, the heavy doors hissed, sliding open. Together, they hauled the unconscious guard into the room.</p>\n<p>Once inside, Damian turned to Arthur. \"We\u2019re nearly done\" he said, \"Let's grab the prize and get out.\"</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The room they stepped into was a stark contrast to the metallic corridors outside. It was filled with glowing screens and blinking lights. And there, in the center of the room, lay their prize - the AI chip. It was encased in a crystal-clear dome, protected by a shimmering energy field that pulsed with raw power.</p>\n<p>The AI chip was rumoured to be unlike any other before it. After the push for AI advancement by President Lucien, AI models in the 23rd century all had open access to large public databases such as the internet, this along with various improvements in the industry quickly gave rise to self-learning AI models. However, it soon became evident that were limited by their parameters which was stuck in the trillions. This AI chip, created by Zenith, was said to be the first that broke the trillion limit, achieving 223 quadrillion parameters. Even Damian had no idea what it could achieve.</p>\n<p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d Damian sighed as he walked forward, he then reached into his backpack, pulling out a small device. \"The disruptor,\" he said, flipping a switch. The device hummed to life and the light at its end glowed purple.</p>\n<p>He held it out towards the energy field. A beam of light shot out from the disruptor, hitting the energy field. There was a crackle and the field flickered as it tried to resist.</p>\n<p><strong>\u201cWarning! Warning! Code Red!\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>Alarms began to wail as red lights flashed. Arthur glanced nervously at the door. \"Hurry up, Damian,\" he urged, \"The guards will be back any second.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm going as fast as I can,\" Damian shot back, his focus on the energy field which grew weaker by the second.</p>\n<p>After a few tense moments, the field finally dissipated. Damian reached in, his fingers closing around the AI chip. As soon as he touched it, the chip lit up.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Scanning host,\"</strong> a mechanical voice echoed.</p>\n<p>Damian jumped, startled. \"What in the-\"</p>\n<p>Arthur turned to him, his eyes wide. \"Damian, what are you doing? We need to leave!\"</p>\n<p>\"I didn't do anything, Arthur!\" Damian insisted, confusion clear in his voice.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Scanning complete.\" </strong>Suddenly, the chip dissolved, its material seeping into Damian's hand like water soaking into a sponge.</p>\n<p><strong>\u201cMerging process initiated. Please accept the process or face unexpected consequences.\"</strong></p>\n<p>Damian's face paled at the threat. He felt the chip, now liquid, begin to slither up the inside of his arm. His veins glowed, the purple light tracing the path of the chip, as it moved steadily towards his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhh.\u201d</p>\n<p>He fell to his knees, clutching his head as the light reached his brain.</p>\n<p>\u201cDamian, get up!\u201d Arthur bent down, grunting as he heaved Damian off the cold floor. He slung Damian's arm over his shoulder, steadying them both as they started for the exit.</p>\n<p>\"Which way, Damian?\" Arthur asked, his voice shaky. Damian was disoriented, his face pale and sweat-soaked. He was in obvious pain, his brows furrowed and his jaw clenched.</p>\n<p>\"Left...then...right...\" Damian gasped out.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, a loud explosion boomed behind them, shaking the very floor they walked on. Dust rained from the ceiling, and the lights flickered ominously.</p>\n<p>Arthur froze as his eyes widened. \"Damian, was that you?\" he asked, his voice shaky.</p>\n<p>With a lot of effort, Damian managed to stand on his own, shaking his head. \"No... I saved the explosives for... for the exit.\"</p>\n<p>\"What?! That wasn't part of the plan, Damian!\" Arthur protested, shock evident on his face. \"We can't hurt anyone!\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't have a choice, Arthur!\" Damian shot back, pulling out the ID card and sliding it through the entrance to the underground tunnels. \"There's no other way out.\"</p>\n<p>Digging into his backpack, Damian pulled out a small box the size of an ice cube. He pressed a button on it and it quickly expanded into a neat pile of explosives.</p>\n<p>Damian moved with lightning speed, attaching the explosives to the walls of the entrance. Arthur watched, his heart pounding in his chest as the heavy footsteps of the guards echoed down the hallway, growing louder with each passing second.</p>\n<p>\"Arthur, we need to run!\" Damian shouted, glancing back at the guards. With one last look at his friend, he turned and sprinted into the underground passage.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Wait up!\u201d</p>\n<p>Damian ignored him as he focused on making as much distance between himself and the entrance, he did not want to be caught in the blast. When he looked over his shoulder, he saw Arthur lagging behind, his face twisted in fear as the guards appeared.</p>\n<p>\"I'm so sorry, Arthur,\" Damian whispered. A pang of regret washed over him as he thought of his friend, his partner in crime, his brother in all but blood.</p>\n<p>With a heavy heart, Damian pressed the trigger, setting off the explosives. The world shook as the blast ripped through the entrance, the walls caving in and sending a shower of dust and debris into the air. The path behind them was sealed off, blocking any pursuit from the guards.</p>\n<p>But the blast was more powerful than what Damian had anticipated. He was thrown forward, tumbling through the underground passage. Using the momentum, he rolled, managing to right himself and keep going. But when he looked back, his heart sank.</p>\n<p>It was as he feared, Arthur had been caught in the explosion. Damian could only hope that his friend had somehow survived the blast, but he knew that was far from possible.</p>\n<p>His chest felt heavy, his mind a whirl of thoughts and emotions. But now was not the time to mourn or regret. He had to keep moving. For himself. For Arthur. For their greatest heist.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Stumbling out of the underground tunnels, Damian breathed in the fresh air. He leaned against the cool stone wall as he tried to catch his breath. His eyes drifted upwards to the full moon that hung in the night sky, casting an ethereal glow over the landscape. A sigh escaped his lips.</p>\n<p>\"Get a grip, Damian,\" he muttered to himself, shaking his head as if to dispel the guilt gnawing at his insides.</p>\n<p>But just as he was about to push on, something changed. He tripped over as his vision blurred. After righting himself, he opened eyes. He realized that everything was clearer, color was more vibrant, he could see details that he never remembered seeing before. And in the top right of his field of vision, a progress bar appeared, with the words 'Merge 90% complete'.</p>\n<p>The AI chip. Of course. Created by Zenith Corp, it was in its beta testing phase, yet the rumours were that it surpassed any existing AI in its capabilities. Damian had planned to use this AI, not for malicious purposes, but for the advancement of science and technology. He dreamt of his name going down in history as a great scientist, an engineer, a pioneer.</p>\n<p>As he trudged on, memories of his past career came flooding back. From his school days to college, he had excelled, always at the top of his class. But when it came to his professional life, he had always fallen short. Despite his best efforts, he had never managed to make any revolutionary discoveries or contribute anything groundbreaking to the world of science and technology.</p>\n<p>The thought of himself as a failure was a bitter pill to swallow. Frustrated and desperate, he had made the choice to steal others' works, to use their brilliance to shine. Now, he was Damian Hawthorne, a respected name in the scientific community. As for the whispers of his dishonest means, Damian was smart enough to silence them.</p>\n<p>Damian looked at the progress bar and noticed it was flickering at 99%.</p>\n<p>\"What's going to happen when it reaches 100%?\" he whispered to himself.</p>\n<p>But before he could dwell on his thoughts, a loud crack echoed in the still night air. The sharp report of a gunshot. His eyes widened in shock as he felt a searing pain shoot through his chest. He stumbled forward, his hands grasping at the tree before him as he tried to stay standing.</p>\n<p>\u201cN-No, not yet,\u201d he coughed out, struggling to speak. With each ragged breath, he felt his strength drain away. He leaned heavily against the tree, his eyes wide and his face drained of colour. Finally, with a resounding thud, he collapsed.</p>\n<p>Damian Hawthorne was no more.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Merging complete. Hello, Master. How can I assist you?\"</strong></p>\n            </div>",

One stream hugged the city walls to the east, the other to the west.</p>\n<p>The eastern stream basked in the sun from dawn till mid-day. Its currents ran warm and sparkled playfully, like there were diamonds hiding in the water. In the lazy days of summer it was beloved by children and trout alike.</p>\n<p>The western stream was shadowed by mountains which stole its fair share of sunlight. Its currents were clear and wicked cold. If you got too close, its waves seemed to snap at your toes. When the fish came through the White River, they knew better than to go west.</p>\n<p>It was a constant wonder to visitors how these two streams could differ so, when they shared the same source...</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a mansion at the point where this river split in two. It belonged to one of the most important men in not only Jade Dragon City, but the whole of the Song Dynasty\u2014Shao Yang, General of the Song Armies, known far and wide as the Lion of the West. It was said there was not a demon in the world he feared.</p>\n<p>But on this night his fists were white-knuckled as he paced back and forth, worrying a groove in the floorboards.</p>\n<p>Tonight, his wife gave birth. And it was a more troubled birth than any had expected. Sweat gleamed on the midwife\u2019s brow, sweat dripped down his wife\u2019s face. At last she gave a scream.</p>\n<p>There was a shockwave of power. It whipped through the room, raising all the hairs on Shao\u2019s body. It tore into the streets beyond, and every lamp it passed sparked out.</p>\n<p>Far above, a star shot across the sky, right over his mansion. To the residents of Jade Dragon City, it could mean only one thing.</p>\n<p>By the time the night had passed, every man, woman, had heard the news\u2014</p>\n<p>The Hero of Prophecy was born.</p>\n<p>Jin Yang of Jade Dragon City, fated to vanquish the Lord of Demons and bring peace to the land.

A girl by the name of Ruyi. It was as though the Heavens could not give without taking, and the price for his blessing was her curse. Where Jin was born with a magical core of incredible potential, Ruyi had no core at all.</p>\n<p>But two split streams still share the same source.</p>\n<p>Jin had courage, drive, intelligence, and ambition fit for a hero.

I\u2019d barely opened my eyes when I was greeted by the sight of his pale, handsome face and his soulless black eyes as he stood over me.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank Khavura,\u201d he said, invoking his patron god for no reason, \u201cyou\u2019re awake.\u201d He offered the same shadow of a smile I used to mistake as affection. \u201cThought you\u2019d look bigger\u2014stronger\u2014by now, but you still don\u2019t look like much, Geram.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019d knocked me out while I was asleep, hadn\u2019t he? Explained my growing headache.</p>\n<p>We were still in my dorm room, so he hadn\u2019t taken me anywhere. If there were more space in here, <strong>[Forgotten Son] </strong>might\u2019ve worked to slip his attention away from me. I\u2019d have to find another way to get the hell away from him.</p>\n<p>I mirrored his smile. \u201cHard to look like much when my hands and feet are tied to a chair.\u201d</p>\n<p>His eyebrows pushed together. On any other face, maybe it was a look of concern. On him, I wasn\u2019t sure, especially in the flickering candlelight. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend like you have no idea why I didn't have any other choice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019m not <em>pretending</em> like I don\u2019t know\u2026and really don\u2019t know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Father said nothing to that\u2014usual for him, as a man of few expressions and fewer words. He paced a circle around me with his arms crossed over his chest, and my eyes followed his feet to find a rune drawn out in black sand around my chair.</p>\n<p>Was it the same rune he\u2019d used to bind Mother when he killed her?</p>\n<p>Was he here to kill me?</p>\n<p>He stopped in front of me, the wood floor giving a creak. He was as tall and imposing as ever, the difference in our strength a palpable tension between us. A pressure that made me want to cower, avert my gaze, obey his command.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will humor you,\u201d he said, tone low and menacing. \u201cIf only because I want to believe you don\u2019t know for a little longer. I have some questions for you. Particularly about what happened to Lando.\u201d</p>\n<p>The brother I killed two years ago who very much deserved it for the part he played in Mother\u2019s murder?</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened to Lando?\u201d I asked.</p>\n<p>His merciless gaze met mine, and something sparked in his eyes. A skill. \u201cTry again.\u201d</p>\n<p>My chest tightened, and dread clawed around my throat.</p>\n<p><em>He knows.</em></p>\n<p>He was going to kill me like he\u2019d killed Mother. I\u2019d be found dead in the morning. He\u2019ll put a dagger through my heart and watch me bleed out. Or choke me to death, throat bruised from his grip. Or slice my head clean off my shoulders\u2014</p>\n<p><em>No, stop panicking</em>.</p>\n<p>I activated<strong> [Cold-Blooded Nature]</strong> to stop myself from begging for my life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\u3010<strong>NOTICE</strong>\u3011</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">You have activated Cold-Blooded Nature [Uncommon]. <br>Your senses have sharpened to maintain complete clarity in any situation, giving you control over your mind and body and making you immune to experiences of pain, paralysis, mind control, and brainwashing for one hour a day.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clarity slammed into me like a fist of ice: I hadn\u2019t been as careful as I\u2019d thought about hiding my involvement in Lando\u2019s death, and now I was reaping what I\u2019d sown.</p>\n<p>Even though I\u2019d done nothing worse than what they\u2019d all done to Mother.</p>\n<p>My memories of her death were a little hazy, especially since I\u2019d been only eight years old. Back before I\u2019d completed the tutorial stage or got a class. When I\u2019d lived with Mother in the countryside so she wouldn\u2019t be alone while she was sick. Father had said he\u2019d found a doctor to treat her, and instead, he\u2019d killed her with his own two hands.</p>\n<p>Up until a handful of years ago, I\u2019d wanted to believe it\u2019d been a nightmare. But eventually I\u2019d pieced together enough of what\u2019d happened that I had to face reality. I\u2019d been living with murderers.</p>\n<p>Planning revenge for her death had come quickly after that. All about the right target, right place, right time. Lando, in his own bedroom, when he took his bitter nightcap to help him sleep. There was no evidence that I\u2019d been the one who\u2019d acquired the poison or put it into his drink. Nothing to indicate that I\u2019d been involved in his death at all. I was sure of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I know what happened with Lando?\u201d I asked.</p>\n<p>Father squared his shoulders and looked down on me with disappointment. He didn\u2019t get to be disappointed in me, though. He needed to die just like Lando.</p>\n<p>\u201cTry again,\u201d he repeated himself, this time in a husky rasp.</p>\n<p>Lando had only been the first because he was the easiest. Just had to ask him if he\u2019d help me debut in high society. Of course he\u2019d agreed so that he could take credit for how well I did. In exchange, I\u2019d learned how to poison him in a way that couldn\u2019t be traced back to me.</p>\n<p>Even with all my training the last two years, I was still only Level 20. Father was at Level 92 because of his decades of experience raiding dungeons as the duke. That meant he had better stats than me, nearly twice as many skills as me, and he\u2019d been able to evolve them far past where I\u2019d been able to evolve mine.</p>\n<p>That didn\u2019t factor in the large discrepancy in how much magic we could use because the quality of his soul was significantly better than mine at SSS-Rank. And there wasn\u2019t anything I could do to close that canyon of magical potential between us.</p>\n<p>Two years in the north wasn\u2019t enough, even with Helas teaching me how to fight.</p>\n<p>Still, I needed to escape if I didn\u2019t want to die.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I know anything more than you do about his death?\u201d I asked instead of answering him again.</p>\n<p>\u201cKhavura give me patience,\u201d Father mumbled under his breath. \u201cYou\u2019re still my son, and so I\u2019ll give you one last opportunity.\u201d</p>\n<p>I glanced at the rune on the floor. Now with a clear head, I recognized it: <em>dio rakaz\u2014</em>destroy magic in the language of the gods. The anti-magic spell. Panic crept down my back like a cold drop of water. I clenched my teeth against it.</p>\n<p>If I couldn\u2019t use magic to escape, then I\u2019d rely on my skills. I activated <strong>[Revenge Best Served Cold]</strong>. The skill had helped me plan one perfect murder already. I just needed to know one of Father\u2019s weaknesses\u2014anything that I could exploit to get out of this.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\u3010<strong>NOTICE</strong>\u3011</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">You have activated Revenge Best Served Cold [Uncommon] for the first time today. <br>Your awareness broadens to uncover up to two of your target\u2019s weaknesses if they possess any.

Where have you been for the last two years?\u201d</p>\n<p>If he was here, didn\u2019t he already know? \u201cRight here where you found me. Bolstaor University, in the capital of S\u00f8rgentsen.

What about you? Doing everything a father should do for his sons?\u201d</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t need to know about Helas. Even if putting him on her trail might get him killed by her, I couldn\u2019t risk it if I wasn\u2019t even going to be around to be sure.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did you come to S\u00f8rgentsen, Geram?\u201d</p>\n<p>So maybe he already knew about her. That I\u2019d tracked her here to train with her so I could kill him and my other brother Boyet, Father\u2019s little sword master prot\u00e9g\u00e9. How long would he let me stall without giving him the answers he wanted?</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause Bolstaor is known for its potions program?\u201d I said. \u201cI figured if I was going to study potions, I should learn from all the best.\u201d</p>\n<p>Father stamped his wooden cane in front of him\u2014a familiar move. He didn\u2019t need it as a walking aid, but because it was by his side all the time, it was easy to forget that it was his favorite weapon. A threat if I\u2019d ever seen one.</p>\n<p>\u201cOr\u2026not?\u201d I faltered on purpose, pulling my gaze from the cane he clearly wanted to beat me with. \u201cHelp your youngest son out a bit here. What answer are you looking for from me here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Why was<strong> [Revenge Best Served Cold]</strong> taking so long? An old injury, a fleeting feeling of inferiority or fear, or even something as simple as the urge to check my bindings.</p>\n<p><em>Just one weakness.

You\u2019re going to answer me with the truth because anything else will get you executed. By me. I\u2019ll cut your lying tongue out myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Great image.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\u3010<strong>NOTICE</strong>\u3011</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">Unfortunately, your target has no weaknesses that you can exploit.<br>You may activate Revenge Best Served Cold [Uncommon] once more today.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I could\u2019ve laughed.

What did I have to lose if I was going to die anyway?</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll start from the beginning,\u201d I said, nodding as if I\u2019d decided to suddenly cooperate.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine.\u201d Father raised his eyes to the low ceilings. Probably praying to Khavura for even more patience.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe not at the very beginning because, I\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t remember much from before Mother got sick. Too young probably. Or just nothing worth remembering?\u201d</p>\n<p>He made no reaction, which wasn\u2019t satisfying at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll start with my most important memory from when I was younger. I\u2019d have you take a guess, but you haven\u2019t answered any of my questions so far. Should be obvious anyway. It\u2019s the day Mother died.\u201d</p>\n<p>Something in the room shifted.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you remember?\u201d I continued. Still no reaction. His angled features were stone. \u201cYou were there. So were Boyet and Lando. We had a nice family dinner for the first time since Mother got sick before we all gathered in the reception room to meet this doctor you\u2019d found who could cure her. That was <em>not</em> what happened though, did it?\u201d</p>\n<p>This time I chuckled. \u201cWho knew <em>you</em> were the doctor and that your cure was <em>killing her</em>? You choked her until she fell at your feet. And if that wasn\u2019t enough, you stabbed her in the heart and then cut off her head. Were you scared she\u2019d come back to life?\u201d</p>\n<p>Father said nothing. I could not possibly hate this man any more. I wanted to smile at that, but I managed to keep it off my face. Lando had taught me well.</p>\n<p>I kept going. \u201cLet me guess. Why would you know what happened with Mother? Why would you know anything more than I do about her death? At least I had a reason for what I did. I wanted revenge. What did you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>Father kicked over my chair, and I fell backward with a grunt, my bound hands crushing into the small of my back. The impact sent a sharp stabbing pain into the joints in my shoulders and arms. Vials on my potion table rattled against their metal holders.</p>\n<p>He put his boot on the seat of my chair between my legs, leaned over his knee until our eyes met. His long black hair fell over his shoulder and into my face. \u201cSo you do remember that day. Lando, though, had nothing to do with that woman\u2019s death.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>That woman?</em></p>\n<p>The terror of my impending death faded into anger quickly.</p>\n<p>\u201cLando and Boyet both watched you kill <em>Mother</em> and did nothing to stop you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Father cracked his neck, the movement and angle inhuman, the sound far too loud. His fair skin reddened like burning flesh, crimson ram horns growing from his forehead and twisting into shape. The face of a demon\u2014something I\u2019d only seen in the nightmares I\u2019d written off as fiction.</p>\n<p>But how?</p>\n<p>The little sounds I\u2019d registered without much notice before joining the ear-splitting buzz of <strong>[Cold-Blooded Nature]</strong> warning me of danger. The wind rattling the windows above my potions table and the snow fluttering against the glass. Father\u2019s hoarse breathing and the aberrant beating of his heart.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about Lando,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why are you here?\u201d I had to laugh. Now that was satisfying. Couldn\u2019t remember when I last laughed like this. The sound rolled out of me without effort, bursting from the part of my soul that ached for revenge the most.</p>\n<p>Father lifted his boot away and rounded the chair. Breathless, I struggled against the rope binding my hands and feet to the chair as he kneeled at my side.</p>\n<p>\u201cI needed to assess whether you know too much,\u201d he whispered.</p>\n<p>His mouth started tearing at the corners and splitting across his face. His rare smile accompanied pointed teeth.</p>\n<p>Had a demon possessed my father?</p>\n<p>How could that have happened?</p>\n<p>When could it have happened?</p>\n<p>Silent realization cut through the noise, replacing it with an overwhelming sense that I had the answer\u2014answers. That I\u2019d had them all along. My nightmares had been screaming at me that there had been one last ugly truth I had to remember.</p>\n<p>But it was too late.</p>\n<p>Father slid his red-scaled clawed grip down the length of his cane to the opposite end. He raised it above his head as he stood and brought down its rounded handle with all his weight.</p>\n<p>Pain exploded across my face. My skull cracked along my forehead with the first hit. The second shattered a cheekbone. The third burst through my eye socket. I lost track after that.</p>\n<p>I shouldn\u2019t have been able to stay conscious, but <strong>[Cold-Blooded Nature]</strong> ensured that I did until he\u2019d finished, cleaned off the handle of his cane, and walked out of the room.</p>\n<p>My final breath came quickly after that.</p>\n<p>But I didn\u2019t <em>want</em> to die. I wasn\u2019t ready.</p>\n<p><em>No</em>, I had to survive this\u2014no matter what it took. I refused to die with my entire being. Even after my heart stopped beating, I willed something <em>else</em> to pulse within me.</p>\n<p>And something did.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\u3016<strong>NOTICE</strong>\u3017</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">You have successfully started to tether your Demon Core [1%].<br>You now qualify to become a Slayer [Transcendental].</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">Do you accept this Class change?</p>\n            </div>",

The last members of the Humanoid Races were assembled in this underground chamber, a testament to how few were left.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">The Council had done everything possible to preserve the Humans' way of life. Magical and physical barriers had been erected all around their territory\u2026 but it hadn't been enough. There, the last hundred survivors stood, looking up at the old man with fearful yet resolute gazes.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">He sighed, his age showing in his raspy breath. For months, he viewed the situation from every angle, but he couldn't see another way out. The Elves and Dwarves to the east and west had been eliminated. To the north, the great Dragons were being pushed back, having refused to assist or join the others.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">The ground trembled slightly, likely from another of the many barriers being shattered as the Demon army made its way inward. He turned his attention to the walls, floor, and ceiling where tens of thousands of intricately carved runes had been etched into the earth.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">After inspecting the Formation, he nodded and placed four fingers from his right hand onto his left shoulder. The others repeated the gesture, some with three fingers and others with two.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\"It's time,\" he motioned to the members of the Council, who worked to situate the remaining Humans into each of the carved circles spread throughout the massive Formation. Some individuals stumbled as another explosion shook the chamber, this one much closer than the last.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">They brushed themselves off and proceeded to their proper places without a change to their demeanor. There was no time for indecision or losing composure. These individuals were hand-picked for this assignment, and they knew what was at stake.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">The few open spaces in the outer Formation were soon loaded, and the Council rushed to fill the inner ring. Standing in one of four spaces in the center, the old man watched as the Formation was filled\u2026 and then he began to chant.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">His voice resounded throughout the chamber, carrying much further than any Human should have been capable. A blue aura shone around him, and tendrils of translucent blue extended, reaching toward the auras that now radiated from every man and woman present.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">As one, each tendril meshed with another aura, and every Human began to chant in sync with the old man. A cacophony of voices merged, and a brilliant blue luster erupted from the surrounding Formation. Runes projected from the ceiling and cast themselves down upon the individual mages. Pain erupted in each of them, but none dared stop chanting.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">Inside their minds, a peculiar event was taking place. The vast oceans of energy that comprised each of their consciousnesses were being shredded and condensed. One by one, the last members of humanity began to fall as the condensed power was ripped from their bodies.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">Those who fell first stood on the outer ring of the Formation. Blood erupted from every orifice as the energy departed, leaving them nothing more than dried husks on the radiant floor.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">Before long, only the Council in the inner ring was left standing. The vast pools of energy within each of them took longer to condense, prolonging the pain and suffering of rending their souls. They fell slowly, one after another, as their bodies shrunk and aged.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">The Formation greedily drew in every remnant of their essence, not stopping even when only four individuals remained standing in the center. Three elderly women chanted and gazed at the grizzled man in the center with hopeful eyes.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">His hands worked furiously, drawing pattern after pattern in the air, each bursting into light as they took the shape of intricate Runes. He spun slowly, tears welling in his eyes when he saw the blood streaming from their bodies.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">The chanting stopped, and the man forced himself to watch as the first two women fell. His hands almost stopped moving as his body instinctually tried to reach out. He slowly turned to face the final member of the Council.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\"><em>\"I love you,\" </em>it was hardly a whisper in the rushing vortex of energy that surrounded them, but he heard it clearly. The last of his being reached out, struggling to form a connection with what remained of hers.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\"><em>\"Let us live our next life in harmony,\" </em>through their connection, every emotion they felt in that moment was shared between the two. The woman collapsed, her knees striking the ground before she fell flat at the altar.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">The tears the man held back gushed forth in a torrent, turning a deep red as his essence continued to drain. His hands moved faster, one Rune after another erupting from his fingertips. Abruptly, the man ceased his movements\u2026 and his body disintegrated.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">A maelstrom of energy burst from his being, flooding the room with a haze of blue light. The Formation worked furiously, flickering in and out of existence as it tried to draw in this wellspring of energy. After several minutes, the room was void of every trace of the essence that had been given, and the Formation gradually faded into nothingness.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">***</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\"><em>Thunk!</em></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">The cavern wall shuddered violently. Debris fell from the ceiling of the stone lair, showering the bloody scene below.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\"><em>Thud! Craack!</em></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">Cracks splintered across the wall, and one chunk of stone after another tumbled inward. A shriveled grey face poked through one of the gaps, its four eyes peering curiously into the room. The eyes moved independently of each other as they surveyed the scene.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\"It'ssss all clear\u2026\" the creature hissed and backed away from the crumbling wall. Another impact bashed the wall, and the weakened structure gave way, collapsing to reveal three hideous forms waiting on the other side. One proceeded casually, its body made of nothing but tentacles and hundreds of multi-colored eyes. A slick, inky substance secreted from its limbs as it moved forward.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">Its many eyes darted around to chamber, surveying the bloodied and broken corpses of the humans littered about the place. The stone was clean aside from the blood splattered across the place. No tricks, no last-ditch efforts. The Humans had come to this place to perish where their cores couldn't be taken.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\"Hahaha!\" the aberration's voice resounded through the chamber, sounding as if it came from everywhere and nowhere. Four of its eyes swiveled to the small, grey creature. \"Tell the Lord the Humans are finished.\"</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">Swiftly, the creature retreated. It sped up the recently carved tunnel and leaped out beneath the night sky. A colossal figure stood silently, perched above the makeshift entrance and looking patiently at the stars above.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\"Lord-\" the diminutive creature made to speak but was directly interrupted.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\"One day, it will all be ours\u2026\" the terror's voice rumbled, shaking the ground beneath it.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\"Lord\u2026\" the creature swallowed and tried again. \"Our business with the Humans has concluded. It seems they preferred to end themselves rather than allow us to assimilate their power. There wasn't a trace of life in the chamber.\"</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">The Lord only spared the creature a glance at the news, \"There is more to what you saw than self-destruction. Not that it matters now.\"</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\"My Lord..?\"</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\"Just prepare the troops to move out,\" the Lord spoke evenly. \"It's time we end the Dragons' resistance.\"</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\"As you wish,\" the grey figure bowed and rushed away.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">The towering creature continued its observance of the night sky, its eyes not shifting from a single point. As it scrutinized the space, a cluster of stars shifted and glided across the heavens.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">None of the Lord's servants were present to hear the sad sigh that escaped its chest.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">***</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">Kyle's eyes fluttered open. He looked around frantically for a moment before realizing he was home, sprawling back on the couch. He calmed down, and a movement on his lap made him look down, where he found his six-year-old daughter splayed across his legs with drool hanging from her lips.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">He chuckled silently and wiped the drool away with the tail of his shirt. The little blonde-haired girl snorted and wriggled closer, curling up tightly against his stomach. Kyle tenderly patted her head before settling back on the couch with a frown.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\"><em>That dream\u2026</em></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">Gently massaging his temples, Kyle sat back with his eyes closed and tried to recall what had happened. He'd dreamed of some of those characters before in different settings. That particular dream\u2026 well, it had just been depressing. He opened his eyes and gazed at the return grille in the ceiling.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\"><em>Hmm\u2026 looks like it's time to change the air filter again. Damn. I swear I just did it not too long ago, didn\u2019t I?</em></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">He glanced at his watch and saw it was already two in the morning. Moving slowly, he lifted his daughter and carried her to bed, cautiously maneuvering around the many stuffed unicorns that covered her bedroom floor.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\"I love you, Littles,\" Kyle tucked her in and kissed her forehead before stealthily leaving the room. He crept across the hall and walked carefully into another room, biting his lip when he stepped on a tiny Lego.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">He limped over, knelt by the wooden bunkbed, and saw his youngest son sleeping peacefully with a stuffed Cthulhu in his arms--a toy he'd begged for during their last visit to the bookstore. It wasn't really in their budget, but he couldn't deny the little runt.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">It hadn't been an easy year. At the end of the previous year, Kyle's company went under due to the pandemic, and they only managed to settle their debts by cashing out his 401k. He'd worked a few odd jobs from there, which had been floating them along throughout the year, but funds were getting tight again.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">He'd tried to find another job repairing industrial heating and air units, but most factories were still shut down, and no one was hiring. On the residential side, no one he spoke with wanted a diagnostic technician. They wanted <em>salesmen</em>. Still, he was good with money, and his kids were warm and fed. That's what mattered. There\u2026 just wouldn't be any extras for a time.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\"><em>Ah, well. That little gig I got in the mornin\u2019 ought to pay pretty good if the problem is what I think it is. I know damn well that ol\u2019 Stumpy ain\u2019t had his equipment maintenanced since he went in on that strip mall last year, so the coils gotta be filthy. Filters prolly ain\u2019t been changed either. I\u2019ll give \u2018em a good price and try an\u2019 get a quarterly contract with \u2018em. Hell, maybe he can get me in touch with the other owner. Pretty sure Stumpy said ol\u2019 boy has a few other facilities that need lookin\u2019 after. One with an ol\u2019 chiller that\u2019s been givin\u2019 \u2018em trouble in the warmer months. Hard to find a tech \u2018round here that\u2019s worth a damn that ain\u2019t workin\u2019 for someone chargin\u2019 an arm and a leg.</em></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">Kyle pulled the covers up over his boy\u2014knowing they\u2019d just get kicked off again after a half-hour or so\u2014and stood, looking at the neatly made and empty top bunk. His oldest son would have been there, but he was at his mother's for the week. Summer had only recently ended, but Kyle was already looking forward to the next so they could spend more time together. He laid his hand on the untouched pillow and sighed before leaving the room, grunting as he stepped on the same Lego as before.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\"><em>Gods damnit!</em></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">He hobbled over to the fridge, grabbed a cold beer, and walked out the back door, not wanting to end the quiet that pervaded his home. That would end in a few hours when he woke his wife to prepare breakfast. Kyle would get the kids up and ready for their lessons, and his mother would arrive in the late morning and facilitate their homeschooling\u2014she was good with that, but he did have to watch her lest she push his kids as hard as she\u2019d pushed him. That was something he didn\u2019t want them to experience, and he didn\u2019t want them growing up feeling like they weren\u2019t good enough just because they brought home a <em>B+</em> instead of an <em>A</em>.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\"><em>Maybe if I hadn\u2019t growed to hate it so much, I\u2019dda gone to college instead o\u2019 goin\u2019 into the trades. With some kinda physics degree, maybe they\u2019d let me teach full time out at the community college instead o\u2019 just the two nights a week I get now. Teachin\u2019 full time wouldn\u2019t be too bad now that I ain\u2019t gotta work myself to death no more. Not that I regret the path I chose. I ain\u2019t in debt an\u2019 the money\u2019s damn good when there\u2019s work to be had\u2026</em> He twisted his back awkwardly, and it <em>cracked</em> in several places\u2026 <em>but damn, if it ain\u2019t bad on these bones. </em></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\"><em> </em></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\"><em>Hell, I might could still go if I wanted. Prolly been too long for \u2018em to accept my four-point-eight GPA from my ol\u2019 transcript. Hmm\u2026 I think Miss Green is still the counselor down at the school. I\u2019ll give her a call on the way to that job tomorrow an\u2019 see what she thinks. If there\u2019s a way to skip some o\u2019 the classes an\u2019 just take the Math an\u2019 Physics exams needed for a degree, I\u2019d be willing. Lucky I got in a trade where I still use most of what I learned in those subjects. Might be fine in English. Eh\u2026 prolly </em>wouldn\u2019t<em> do so well if Chemistry or Biology are required\u2026</em></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">He sat his drink on the side of his grill, then relieved himself off the edge of the porch before cracking open the can. Kyle took a deep swig of the sweet nectar and sighed in contentment. He stretched his shoulders and looked around the yard.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">The brisk October air felt nice on his skin, so instead of going back inside, he climbed onto the kids' trampoline and gazed up at the night sky. This was his favorite time of year. Not too hot, not too cold, just right for drinking a glass of whiskey on the porch swing or working on one of his projects in the garage without sweating too much.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">He glanced at the nearby swingset and played back the past weekend. His ex-wife and her husband had come over so all the kids could play together. Kyle threw some patties on the grill, and his wife\u2014Leah\u2014made a casserole while keeping their glasses topped off.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">The kids had a great time, especially once the neighbor's kids came to join the fun. Their parents followed, driving their golf carts and bringing their own beer to drink as they chatted and watched the youngins run around.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">This was a mostly good neighborhood, and the house had been in his family for a while. Kyle had taken over the mortgage after his cousin hit the slammer for drug abuse\u2014it took months and a lot of money to bring the place back up after what it went through, but they'd done it. It was either that or it went to the county, and Kyle wouldn't let the house his grandpa built go, not like that.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">Even after making the place one of the nicest in their little community and making friends with most of the neighbors, there were still a few who looked at him and his wife as if <em>they </em>were the criminals. He'd tried to be amicable at first, but after having the cops called on him every time he played his music a bit too loud\u2014even in the middle of the day\u2014he'd stopped with the niceties, even going so far as to turn his music a bit louder\u2014during reasonable hours, of course. If they wanted something to gripe about, he\u2019d be happy to give it to \u2018em.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">Kyle had known a few of the deputies, which helped the situation, but they'd had to follow protocol regardless. After so many visits without there being any evidence of wrongdoing, the two busybodies who\u2019d made the complaints were flagged as 'nuisance callers', and the problem fixed itself. Sure, it was water under the bridge at this point, but that didn\u2019t mean those occurrences hadn\u2019t been embarrassing. Even after the officers profusely apologized, it didn't change the fact that they'd been seen in the yard, and word spread. It had taken a few barbeques and some beer to fix his reputation with the other neighbors\u2014which he wouldn\u2019t have bothered with if it weren\u2019t for some of their kids being the same age as his. Looking back, it had been worth it.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\"><em>At least things are better now.</em></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">Kyle turned to look at the large brick home where he'd spent countless days as a boy. He took another sip of his beer, then sighed.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\"><em>Even if Grandpa built it, it's just a house. I'dda left if things had kept on. The last thing I want is for my kids to get picked on cause o\u2019 some crusty old couples. What I wouldn\u2019t give\u2014</em></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">A flash of light broke Kyle's gaze away from the house. He jerked his head and squinted at the stars, wondering if it had been his imagination. Then, there was another flash, and a line of white streaked across the night sky. He opened his eyes wide to watch it pass.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\"><em>The hell was that?</em></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">Kyle watched the sky closely. That <em>hadn't</em> been a meteorite or <em>any</em> sort of space debris\u2014which he'd seen plenty of thanks to his countless nights driving through little nowhere towns when he was working. No, this had been more\u2026 <em>true</em> to the term \"shooting star.\"</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">Another flash\u2026 and then another. Again and again, the stars brightened in the night sky and zipped away until it seemed it was the Earth itself flying through the night. He watched in awe until the sky stilled some minutes later.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\"What in the Sam Hill\u2026?\" Kyle glanced at the can he was holding, took a long, hard look at the beer, wondered if something was in it, then turned back to study the sky.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\"><em>Hmm\u2026 that ain\u2019t right\u2026 Where's Cepheus..? Grus..?</em></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">Kyle stared uncertainly up into the night. As usual, there were hundreds of thousands of teeny lights twinkling in the darkness. Yet these lights seemed\u2026 foreign. He jumped up, and his foot caught on the trampoline's springs in his haste to scramble down, twisting his ankle and causing him to fall face-first into the dirt. One arm stayed high in the air, holding his drink upright.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\"><em>I swear. If it ain't one thing, it's another. </em>He glanced at his hand and grinned. <em>Didn't spill a drop.</em></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\"Ungh,\" grunting, Kyle hauled himself to his feet, chugged the rest of the beer, rubbed his back, and then stumbled inside to grab his phone. He flipped it open, glad to see that there was still a connection. With a few swipes, he'd opened pages on Twitter and Reddit to see if there were any posts about what just happened.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">Nothing.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\"><em>I </em>know <em>I ain\u2019t imagined that\u2026 Well\u2026 </em>Kyle looked at his empty beer can. <em>Nah\u2026 Whatever that warp speed nonsense was, it really happened. Maybe there'll be an article in the morning.</em></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">He tossed the can in his recycle bucket, then hobbled toward his bathroom and began to strip. He unclipped the Glock 19 that stayed tucked in his belt and put it on a nearby shelf\u2014one too high for his kids to reach. His belt was next, then he tossed his shirt and jeans in the hamper. Standing in front of the mirror, he couldn't help but make a face at the changes the years and beers had brought to his body.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">Kyle wasn't quite thirty, but his dark brown hair was already receding\u2014though he'd taken to growing the top long, shaving the sides, and braiding it back down the middle. After dressing up for a few Viking and Renaissance conventions with his friends, he'd just decided to keep it that way. He had brilliant eyes that regularly alternated between cloudy blue or light grey. A thick, curly beard hung from his chin and stopped at the top of his oversized belly.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">Out of habit, he flexed his biceps. His shoulders were broad, his neck was thick, and his chest was beefy and covered by hair. He still had thick arms from lifting weights and turning wrenches, but he didn't eat right, and the most cardio he'd seen in years had been with his wife in the bedroom. Kyle's thighs were as thick as small trees, and his calves were sturdy, a testament to spending nearly a decade toting an eighty-pound toolbag up and down ladders for work. Hauling hundreds of pounds of tools back and forth across scorching factory roofs did wonders for his squat max.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">Even though everything else looked fine, he couldn't help but frown at his gut. Too many nights at the bar with his friends and being spoiled by his wife's cooking had ruined those washboard abs he'd held so dear in his late teens.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">Kyle splashed water on his face and toweled off before climbing into bed, where he pulled out his phone and checked again for any news. Many folks were talking about the incident now, but he couldn't find any official announcements about what the hell happened.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\"><em>At least I know I didn't imagine it. </em></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">Kyle snorted. Since there wasn't any relevant information, he switched to his light novel app and spent the next few minutes reading the latest releases. That done, he thumbed through his other apps hoping to catch a new episode of one of his favorite animes, but nothing had been released yet.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\"Mmm\u2026 Kyle..?\"</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\"Oh hell, I'm sorry, honey. I didn't wake you, did I?\" Kyle asked softly as his wife moved closer. He breathed deeply as the softness of her body pressed against him. \"Sorry. Gettin\u2019 the little critters to sleep took a while, an\u2019 I passed out in there on the couch.\"</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\"Mmmh\u2026\" she buried her face between his arm and pillow. \"Maybe the next one won't be such a night owl.\"</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">He didn't answer, only holding her close and staring at the ceiling. They'd tried for another over the past year, but there were\u2026 complications. Only recently had it seemed that Leah stopped blaming herself for\u2026 the <em>incident</em>\u2026 and wanted to try again. Anger flared, and he balled his fists as memories of that night resurfaced, but he forced them down and let out a sigh.<em> </em></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\"><em> </em></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\"><em>Alright, cool your jets. Nothin\u2019 like that\u2019ll happen again. Not with me standin\u2019 in front of her.</em></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">He gathered himself and decided to change the subject. Making her feel bad by saying something stupid was the last thing he wanted\u2014and if that were an Olympic sport, he\u2019d take home the gold.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\"Oh, yeah! The damnedest thing happened earlier. There were thousands o\u2019-\"</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">Kyle was interrupted by a loud snore coming from under his arm. He chuckled and kissed Leah\u2019s forehead before rolling over and getting comfortable.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 1em\">\"Good talk.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n            </div>",

        "chapter_content": "<div class=\"chapter-inner chapter-content\">\n                <p>A lone ship wandered through a foggy stretch of water, a dimly glowing lantern at its bow.</p>\n<p>Shadowy clouds that had already spent the majority of their moisture still hung above the boat, threatening to drench its sailors with more freezing rain.</p>\n<p>\"Roth, where are we at?\"</p>\n<p>A grizzled middle-aged man stepped down from the bow of the boat, his old leather boots stressing the ship's ancient wooden deck.</p>\n<p>His coat's appearance matched his boots, but was also adorned with a captain's badge. It was a symmetric red star with a raised, white C in the center. The small piece of metal looked as old as his coat, the corners of the star long since dulled by wear.</p>\n<p>\"We should be about 30 kilometers northwest of Whitefish Point right now\u2026\"</p>\n<p>A young man held up a yellow sheepskin map, his emerald eyes squinting as he drew his finger over it. After brushing over a sharp spike of land and passing over a few depth-labeled shallows, his index finger drifted to an area marked as 100+ meters deep.</p>\n<p>\"This fog is too thick for me to see the sky anymore, but I checked just before we got news of the ship going missing\u2026\"</p>\n<p>Roth glanced over to the small wooden room sticking out in the center of the boat, his brow furrowing as he listened to the distant chatter coming from a radio inside of it.</p>\n<p>\"Captain, should we really be out here? This is just an old fishing boat, if a massive freighter like the Big Fitz can just go missing like this\u2026\"</p>\n<p>The young man's words trailed off as the grizzled older man stomped toward him.</p>\n<p>\"And what, run back to shore? Leave all of those men out here to drown?\"</p>\n<p>The captain's hand raised up to his chest, lightly touching the badge pinned to his old jacket. Another small murmur escaped from his mouth, but it was drowned out by a shout from the front of the boat.</p>\n<p>\"I see something!\"</p>\n<p>Both Roth and the captain rushed to the front of their small boat, joining two other men who were already there.</p>\n<p>\"Look, Captain Holl! I see someone moving around over there!\"</p>\n<p>Cundy, a sailor who'd been with Holl's crew for years, reached out his arm, pointing at a thick wall of fog.</p>\n<p>Roth hurriedly rolled up his sheepskin map as he joined the other three at the front of the boat, trying to keep the artifact of a map safe from the moisture. After binding it with a leather cord, the young man was about to tuck it inside his jacket when a force suddenly ripped the scroll from his hands.</p>\n<p>Roth looked up in shock, only to see the steaming red face of Captain Holl.</p>\n<p>\"Brat, what the hell is this?! You've led us back to the shore!\"</p>\n<p>\"Wha- what? We've been going away from the bay this whole time\u2026\"</p>\n<p>Roth's voice trailed off as Holl used the map to point toward the wall of fog in front of their ship.</p>\n<p>\"Then what the hell is that?\"</p>\n<p>Roth lifted his head to look where the captain was pointing, and a slight wind seemed to sweep over the boat, pushing the thick layer of fog away and clearing his vision.</p>\n<p>Now, a few dozen meters in front of the boat, Roth could see an island.</p>\n<p>\"See, brat? There are no islands out this far! Hell, I've been sailing this great lake for decades, and I've never seen an island anywhere close to where we should've been going!\"</p>\n<p>The captain's angry rant continued, but it faded away from Roth's attention. His eyes focused on the island before them instead.</p>\n<p>Gloomy, water-laden trees hung over the banks of the island, their lichen-covered branches nearly brushing against the water's surface. The water beneath them sat perfectly still, as did the surface all around the boat.</p>\n<p>It was as smooth as a mirror, yet there were no stars reflected in the depths.</p>\n<p>Just as Roth was about to look away from the island, his eyes caught sight of a figure moving between the branches. His hand instinctively reached down to his belt, lifting a cold metal spyglass to magnify his vision. Even with a small dent in the green tube obscuring part of his vision, Roth could still see the island much better than before.</p>\n<p><em>That\u2026 that's a person!</em></p>\n<p>The shadowy figure paused as it reached a small opening in the hanging trees, then looked up toward the dim lantern hanging on the small fishing boat.</p>\n<p>\"Captain, I think I see something.\"</p>\n<p>The figure on shore waved its hand as if beckoning Roth to follow it, then stepped back from the shore's edge and faded back into the shadowy island.</p>\n<p>\"What do you see, brat? The lost crew? Stop bullshitting me.\"</p>\n<p>Captain Holl tossed Roth's map onto the deck, causing the young man to immediately tuck his spyglass back into his belt and bend down to pick the scroll back up.</p>\n<p>\"Don't drop this map. I already told you, it's old and needs care-\"</p>\n<p>\"Who gives a shit? It's just a useless scroll if you don't know how to read it.\"</p>\n<p>A long sigh left Holl's mouth as he looked back over at the island.</p>\n<p>\"Fuck, this is my fault. I should've known better than to leave everything to a new kid.\"</p>\n<p>Holl was about to open his mouth again, but his words caught in his throat, and he reached down to grab a pair of rubber-coated binoculars from his own waist.</p>\n<p>\"Is that\u2026 there really is someone on there!\"</p>\n<p>The Captain's voice rose as he leaned over the ship's bow, craning over the freezing water below.</p>\n<p>\"It's the crew! It's definitely them!\"</p>\n<p>Roth also lifted his spyglass up again, the old map clutched in his other hand. In his vision, the shore was magnified again. The same weeping trees hung over the water, their branches swaying in unison to an invisible breeze.</p>\n<p>The water's surface remained undisturbed, reflecting nothing but the dull gray fog hanging overhead.</p>\n<p>There were no humans around the shore, even as Roth scanned over the whole island.</p>\n<p>\"I see them too! Captain, we can save them! They must've escaped the Fitz and made it to this island!\"</p>\n<p>Both Cundy and Bindon, the two other crewmen aside from Holl and Roth, also had their gazes fixed on the island.</p>\n<p>\"Where? I don't see anyone now\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"Look, just right of the center! There's a whole group of them standing just off shore!\"</p>\n<p>A shiver ran down Roth's spine as he looked at the specified spot.</p>\n<p>There was nothing.</p>\n<p>Just calm, dark glassy liquid.</p>\n<p>Right at the water's edge, the waterlogged trees hung over the surface.</p>\n<p>Directly beneath them, the surface reflected the foggy gray sky.</p>\n<p>\"Cundy, Bindon, grab the oars! We're saving the lost crew.\"</p>\n<p>Roth's heart started to pound as the two crewmen ran to the sides of the deck and started pulling their boat toward the shore.</p>\n<p>\"Wait, I think something's wrong!\"</p>\n<p>Roth ran over to where Holl was stepping inside the small cabin on the ship's deck.</p>\n<p>\"Captain, please wait! We don't know what this island is!\"</p>\n<p>Holl scoffed as he bent down over a small table.</p>\n<p>\"The lost crew is right there. Surely you aren't such a coward that you want them all to freeze to death here, right?\"</p>\n<p>Holl pulled a small red notebook from a drawer under the table and placed it next to the radio, then flipped it open to the newest page.</p>\n<p>\"Go out to the deck and watch the shore. Help the other two make sure that the landing goes well.\"</p>\n<p>Holl pushed Roth out of the cabin, then scrawled a few notes on the page. Their current position as speculated by Roth, the estimated time, and the current weather conditions.</p>\n<p>He flipped over to the previous page, his eyes narrowing as he read over handwriting neater than his own.</p>\n<p>All of the previously marked notes lined up with what he'd seen, and what Roth had been telling him. There was a rough sketch of a map at the bottom of the page, similar yet less detailed than the one Roth was carrying around.</p>\n<p>Holl tapped his finger on it, his lips starting to curve upward as he pondered on their current location.</p>\n<p>\"The storms and fog can throw anyone off their course\u2026\"</p>\n<p>Aside from the faint noise caused by Holl closing the notebook, the cabin was dead silent.</p>\n<p>\"Hah.\"</p>\n<p>He glanced at the silent radio and let out a dry chuckle, then wiped the small grin off his face as he stood up to head back onto the deck.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>The boat continuously drifted closer to the island, and Roth no longer needed his spyglass to clearly make out the shore. The unnaturally calm water warped as the boat approached the island, but its surface refused to break.</p>\n<p>The eerie feeling in Roth's heart only grew as their boat drifted closer to the shore.</p>\n<p>\"Cundy, shouldn't we stop offshore? If there are rocks or sunken trees, we could damage the ship.\"</p>\n<p>Even if his crewmates couldn't see the irregularity of the island, Roth hoped that they would at least listen to basic seafaring caution.</p>\n<p>\"Our boat is small enough, and we have sails. Even if the prop gets damaged, we'll still be able to bring the Fitz's crew back to land.\"</p>\n<p>Cundy moved the oar steadily, not slowing down even as he saw the fear clearly painted on Roth's face.</p>\n<p>\"Kid, I know you don't have much experience out on the Great Lakes yet, and you've probably heard plenty of stories about the dangers here. Stories of ghosts. Unnatural spikes randomly stabbing up from the lakebed to spear boats.\"</p>\n<p>Cundy's rough voice paused for a moment before he continued.</p>\n<p>\"The lake that never gives up her dead. Just cold even to keep any lost bodies from ever decaying, but not freezing them outright. Eternally laying at the bottom of the lake bed. It's not a good fate.\"</p>\n<p>Cundy shrugged as he continued rowing the boat closer to shore.</p>\n<p>\"It's all legends and stories. The lake is dangerous, but an experienced captain like Holl will have no trouble here.\"</p>\n<p>The fellow sailor's words didn't do anything to comfort Roth.</p>\n<p>\"Wasn't the Fitz's captain experienced, too?\"</p>\n<p>Cundy didn't answer, instead looking up at the shore. Their boat was now only a few meters away and still drifting forward.</p>\n<p>\"The crew must've gone further inland while they waited for us.\"</p>\n<p>Holl's voice echoed from behind Roth, making the young man jump. The captain's hand was up by his chest, continuously fiddling with the metal badge fixed there.</p>\n<p>\"We don't know exactly where we are, it's better to be cautious. It'll do us no favors if we get stuck here, too.\"</p>\n<p>Holl looked between Cundy and Bindon, then nodded.</p>\n<p>\"Tie up the ship, let's find the crew quickly. Keep an eye out for anything strange.\"</p>\n<p>Roth immediately opened his mouth, but Holl brushed off the young man's concerns.</p>\n<p>\"Yep, that's why I'm saying to keep an eye out. We're not familiar with this place, so it's better to be cautious.\"</p>\n<p>There was clearly something wrong with the island.</p>\n<p>Roth couldn't quite place his finger on it, but there was a strong feeling in his gut.</p>\n<p>This place was dangerous.</p>\n<p>\"Captain, can I stay back-\"</p>\n<p>\"Kid, you're going to need to grow up eventually. You can't live afraid of everything.\"</p>\n<p>The bow of their boat bumped into the shore, and Holl started pulling the young man toward a small gap in the waterlogged trees.</p>\n<p>A thick coat of moss draped over every branch, small droplets of water sliding silently down the plants until they fell back into the lake.</p>\n<p>Holl leaped down from the boat, his old leather boots sinking a few centimeters into the wet ground. Steeling his heart, Roth followed the captain down from the safety of the boat. His own boots- similarly made of leather, but with rubber soles and nylon laces- also sank into the muddy bank, quickly becoming coated with a dark brown goo. A few droplets of freezing water splashed up as Cundy and Bindon jumped onto the beach behind him.</p>\n<p>Roth shivered as the freezing November water trickled down the hem of his trousers, finding its way to his skin.</p>\n<p>Captain Holl glanced back and nodded to Binden, then motioned for them to climb off the beach.</p>\n<p>\"Cundy, you take the lead. Kid, you and Bindon watch the back for anything.\"</p>\n<p>Roth kept one of his hands at his waist as he waded through the thick muddy ground, following the other three men off of the beach.</p>\n<p>The young man's eyes flitted around his surroundings as he slowly followed behind Holl. The captain also had his left hand at his own waist, his fingers also on the hilt of a dagger. Cundy was the only one who didn't seem so on edge and even hummed quietly as he pushed past the low-hanging tree branches.</p>\n<p>The ground finally firmed up as they traveled inland, though Roth felt like the floor of wet, rotting leaves wouldn't provide very much grip either.</p>\n<p>\"I don't see any footsteps\u2026 Cundy, we hit shore pretty close to where you saw the crew as well, right?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yep, I think we did a pretty good job of landing 'er right where they were standing.\"</p>\n<p>Roth glanced back at the still water behind them.</p>\n<p><em>Right where they were standing\u2026</em></p>\n<p>Roth could feel shivers just as cold as the freezing November water running down his spine.</p>\n<p>\"T-this island can't be too large, right?\"</p>\n<p>Bindon's long dark hair swayed as he rapidly turned his head, trying to watch every angle at the same time. The terrified expression on his face was a poor match for his crackerjack uniform, which he continued wearing even after having left the Navy for almost a decade.</p>\n<p>Despite only being in his late thirties, Bindon looked a good ten years older and normally acted the part.</p>\n<p>Now, though, his hands were trembling more than Roth had ever seen, even compared to the coldest mornings.</p>\n<p>\"Bindon, what's the matter?\"</p>\n<p>Holl and Cundy halted their advances, and the captain glanced up at the low-hanging, lichen-covered branches.</p>\n<p>\"They're just a bunch of trees. Stop shaking and move, the night is coming.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, captain.\"</p>\n<p>The middle-aged man's hands stopped shaking as he bowed his head, refusing to look back up at the darkening forest. Bindon's long dark hair draped over his cheeks, blocking Roth's vision of the sailor's face.</p>\n<p>Roth's mind only fell further into turmoil as the group continued moving further onto the island. They checked the ground every few meters, but none of them managed to uncover any signs of the lost crew.</p>\n<p><em>Why did I agree to this?! I already thought the captain was a bit nuts when he insisted on going out during a storm, but this is even crazier!</em></p>\n<p>The difference in light between the sky and the forest around them was immense, and every time Roth glanced up at the heavens, the rest of the world looked black and white for a minute afterward. Every time he looked up, there was still the last residual light from the sun, but the stars and moon were completely absent from the sky.</p>\n<p>Just as the group reached a small clearing, Holl held up his hand for the team to halt.</p>\n<p>\"I'm not seeing anything, and it's going to be night soon\u2026 this island seems to be a lot bigger than I thought it would be. Even if it means leaving the crew out in the cold for another night, we need to make sure we are alive to rescue them. Let's head back to the ship for the night.\"</p>\n<p>Roth heaved a deep sigh of relief, but he noticed that Bindon was strangely silent. His head was still hanging at the same angle as before, the long dark strands of hair preventing Roth from seeing his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n            </div>",

An Alabama-drite? Alakazam-drite?\u201d</p>\n<p>Rick massaged the bridge of his nose, \u201cI don\u2019t know.

Check it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimmy held the stone under the bright LED light they used to inspect any gems that came through their pawn shop. The stone was a ruby red under the light. But then Jimmy brought the stone over to the window where it turned green under the sunlight. He looked back at Rick expectantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that certainly fits the description. Where\u2019d you get it? There\u2019s no way that it\u2019s not stolen,\u201d Rick said with a shake of his head. \u201cLet me get a closer look.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimmy gave Rick a look of feigned outrage, \u201cOur customers value the discretion we provide.

It was that Adam kid again,\u201d Jimmy mumbled.</p>\n<p>Rick ran a hand through his hair and sighed, \u201cThat kid\u2019s definitely making a name for himself. People are talking. Next time he comes in, we gotta turn him away.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimmy nodded reluctantly. He knew it was only a matter of time before authorities started sniffing around their shop.</p>\n<p>Rick might seem like the voice of reason, but it pained him too. The kid, Adam, had brought them a lot of fast sellers lately, helping to keep their lights on. Business had been good during the pandemic but had taken a huge step back within the last year. Without Adam, the shop would have been in big trouble.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, let me take a look,\u201d Rick mumbled and brought the loupe and stone up to his eye. \u201cHuh. This might not be Alexandrite, actually. There\u2019s something off here.\u201d</p>\n<p>With his closer inspection, Rick could see a galaxy of colors. They seemed to blink in and out of existence, having a mind of their own. It seemed to pull him in. Even if he had wanted to, he wasn\u2019t sure he could put it down. The stone and colors were just too beautiful.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, man. I bet we can get $50k for that,\u201d Jimmy\u2019s eyes twinkled with greed as he stared at the stone.</p>\n<p>Rick\u2019s eyes also sparkled in greed as he smiled and nodded, \u201cWhat did you give the kid for it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNine hundred bucks. Told him it was fake and that I was doing him a huge favor. I also made sure he knew that we expect him to bring us something real next time,\u201d Jimmy chuckled as he plopped in an office chair. It was a wonder that it didn\u2019t snap under his weight.</p>\n<p>Rick\u2019s expression hadn\u2019t changed. In fact, he felt as if his face was stuck. The small facial muscles were frozen in place as he inspected the stone. The colorful lights inside grew brighter and brighter.</p>\n<p>Rick tried to pry himself away, but his body rebelled. His eye began to throb in pain and his head began to hurt. The pulling sensation ripped through his entire being.</p>\n<p>Jimmy looked at his friend with concern, \u201cUh, Rick? Quit smiling like that. You\u2019re creepin' me out, dude.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rick was panicking inside and began to sweat. He could feel the stone successfully pulling him in. Not his body, but his mind and soul.</p>\n<p>His feeble resistance began to falter. Jimmy was yelling his name but he began to tune him out. His friend\u2019s large hairy hand was shaking his shoulder, much to his annoyance. The outside annoyances made it easier for him to give in to the call of the stone. It was his stone. It felt right.</p>\n<p>As he gave in, the headache vanished as soon as it had come and he felt at peace. Rick closed his eyes and let out a long sigh of breath that he had apparently been holding in. Or, at least he thought he did. Because when he opened his eyes, he jarringly saw his own face staring back at himself wearing that same frozen smile. The image of himself was through a sea of colors and his buddy, Jimmy, was still shouting and trying to shake him.</p>\n<p>He was startled once more as something invaded his mind and vision.</p>\n<p><strong>Compatible Soul Fused. Core Awakened.</strong></p>\n<p>Rick had no idea what the hell that meant as his vision returned to Jimmy creating a commotion. The colors slowly faded, making it easier to see. Jimmy\u2019s eyes widened in horror.</p>\n<p>Rick\u2019s body began to crumble like kindling in a fire. The stone, or Core, clattered to the floor. The rest of his body crumbled and dispersed into ashes floating to the ground. It all happened within seconds.</p>\n<p>Jimmy paced around, grabbing his wispy hair in a panic.</p>\n<p>Rick tried to yell at his friend, but the sound only reached his senses. As he looked down, he realized he didn\u2019t have a body. It was just his consciousness floating within the stone. Or, Core, rather.</p>\n<p>Rick\u2019s vision was once more flooded with another prompt:</p>\n<p><strong>Choose Core Function:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Vengeance Dungeon</strong><br><strong>Hermit Dungeon</strong><br><strong>Challenge Dungeon</strong><br><strong>Hellscape Dungeon</strong><br><strong>Slime Dungeon</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Time Left: 04:48</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d Rick yelled in this new domain.</p>\n<p>There was no answer and the time kept ticking down. He had five minutes to choose one of the five options in front of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cTha\u2019fuck is a \u2018Vengeance Dungeon\u2019?\u201d Rick shouted again, not expecting an answer. Instead, more information was made available to him:</p>\n<p><strong>Vengeance Dungeon: Emit a signal with the promise of riches to lure Challengers. Feast on their souls to gather Hate Points. Spread like a cancer and consume all who would dare to enter your halls.</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cUh, no thanks,\u201d Rick mumbled and checked the time.</p>\n<p><strong>Time Left: 4:01</strong></p>\n<p>Rick realized time was moving fast. Really uninterested to see what happened when the timer ran out, he quickly skimmed the rest of the options and found the one that interested him the most:</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge Dungeon: Lure Challengers with a promise of competition. Reward the strong and brave. Feast on the foolish.</strong></p>\n<p>Rick wasn\u2019t entirely sure of the consequences and there wasn\u2019t time to find out so he mentally selected option three: <strong>Challenge Dungeon</strong>.</p>\n<p>Immediately, Rick\u2019s consciousness spread throughout his pawn shop. He could sense everything within the shop. Including the small diamond ring in Jimmy\u2019s back pocket. Rick had bought it earlier that day and had already forgotten it. Was Jimmy trying to steal it? He wondered. Perhaps he had shown it to a customer and absentmindedly put it in his pocket. Whatever.</p>\n<p>There was even a rare coin in a drawer in Rick\u2019s desk that he had blamed Jimmy for stealing. It made him remember that he had put it there and just forgotten about it.</p>\n<p>The sense of the store around him became an all encompassing vision. He could see all at once as well as focus on one thing at a time. It was an odd sensation, yet it came naturally to Rick.</p>\n<p>He watched Jimmy lock the door of the shop and continue to scramble around. His friend and business partner found some bright yellow rubber gloves and a pair of metal welding tongs. He stared at the yellow gloves for a moment, shook his head, threw them to the side, and grabbed a hazmat suit from a storage closet in the back office. Rick chuckled at remembering how those things sold like hotcakes when the pandemic first started.</p>\n<p>The hazmat suits were Jimmy\u2019s idea and he bought a pallet full of them before panic had spread. Jimmy also insisted on keeping one for costume parties. Not that they had been invited to a costume party in the last decade.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, buddy what the hell am I supposed to do?\u201d Jimmy pleaded as he climbed into the suit which was comically tight on his round frame.</p>\n<p>Rick thought about how he could communicate. The fact that his body has disintegrated into a pile of ash hadn\u2019t fully set in for him. None of this felt real and he couldn\u2019t wrap his mind around it. All he could do was try to tackle one thing at a time.</p>\n<p>Jimmy lumbered over to the stone and plucked it up with the welding tongs then quickly snapped his eyes closed, clearly afraid of suffering the same fate as Rick. \u201cShit, shit, shit,\u201d he chanted.</p>\n<p>Rick didn\u2019t believe he could touch or move anything, but there had to be a way to communicate, he thought while he watched his friend.</p>\n<p>Jimmy blindly shuffled as carefully as possible to the big safe in the office. With one hazmat suit covered hand, he typed in the code, swung the big metal door open, and dropped the stone inside. Once he slammed it shut, he slumped against the wall and sighed.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for not throwing me in the garbage,\u201d Rick said within his domain.</p>\n<p>Despite being in the safe, Rick could still sense everything within the store. He also noticed that he had managed to ignore a prompt that had been waiting for him. He quickly expanded it, worried that there might be another timer. Thankfully, there was not.</p>\n<p><strong>Unnamed Challenge Dungeon (Level 1): Choose Name</strong><br><strong>Energy Available: 100/100</strong><br><strong>Skills: 3</strong><br><strong>Floors: 1</strong><br><strong>Challenge Points: 0</strong><br><strong>Loot Level: 14</strong><br><strong>Floor Bosses: 0</strong><br><strong>Minions: 0</strong><br><strong>Treasure Rooms: 1</strong><br><strong>Dungeon Attendants: 0</strong><br><strong>Challenger Leaderboard: N/A</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u2014ALERT\u2014</strong><br><strong>1 Free Floor Available</strong><br><strong>1 Free Floor Boss Available</strong><br><strong>1 Free Minion Available</strong><br><strong>1 Free Dungeon Attendant Assignment Available</strong></p>\n<p>Rick wondered if he was involved in some kind of government experiment or if he was dreaming. Where was this information coming from? He figured the best way to find out was to study the prompt at the forefront of his mind.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, Jimmy wouldn\u2019t do anything absurd in the next few minutes.</p>\n            </div>",

        "chapter_content": "<div class=\"chapter-inner chapter-content\">\n                <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ryu awoke in a field of lilacs to the sound of a bubbling stream. He sat up quickly, patting his body frantically to make sure every piece of him was still intact. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How?</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> He looked around, taking in his surroundings. He wasn\u2019t in the city anymore. What was he doing all the way out here in the countryside? </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The last thing he remembered was the cat. He sighed wistfully. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I hope it\u2019s safe now.</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> He had saved the poor animal from drowning in the city\u2019s polluted river, jumping in after it had been pinned under some garbage. So, it came as a shock when he heard a little meow next to him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ryu jumped, puzzled to see the black cat. It nuzzled against his leg as he stared at the stream. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Was I carried down by the current?</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> He bent down to scratch the small one\u2019s ears.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cDid you follow me all the way down here, buddy? Aw, you\u2019re sweet, aren\u2019t you? You wanted to make sure I was okay,\u201d he cooed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The cat graciously accepted his hand, purring softly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ryu clicked his tongue staring at the endless expanse of greenery. He had no idea where he was or how to get back to civilization. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Oh!</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Just then, he realized he still had his cell phone with him. Fishing through his pockets, he pulled out a small flip phone, the only model he could afford on his salary. He stared at the black screen, downcast as water dripped from the device. Of course, it wouldn\u2019t work. Ryu was soaked from head to toe, still wearing his Java Roast uniform. It couldn\u2019t have been more than a few hours since he had been carried downstream if he was still this wet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He searched for any signs of life, giving up when it became clear that they were the only two souls out here in the middle of nowhere. Ryu figured picking a direction to walk in would be a good start, choosing to travel in the direction opposing the current\u2019s flow. The cat decided to tag along, trotting beside him. He grew anxious as the minutes ticked by, the sun traveling higher above the horizon. He had picked up a double shift at work tomorrow; he needed to get back home before sundown. Rent was due in a week\u2019s time and Ryu was still short by a good amount. He would have to work extra hours this week to pay on time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Staring at his new companion a depressing thought crossed his mind. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another mouth to feed.</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Maybe the shelter would take her? Though, Ryu was aversive to the idea. What if no one adopted her? Then what? They would euthanize her for sure. No, he couldn\u2019t chance it. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I\u2019ll just see about a second job that I can work on weekends. It\u2019ll be fine. </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He reassured himself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As they continued along the riverside, Ryu paused, staring at the water. He bent low; it was surprisingly clearer than he remembered. He removed his cap, wiping sweat from his brow as the sun beat down on him. The heat must have been getting to him, because when he lifted his head, there seemed to be a forest on the other side of the river. The cat craned its neck to one side, observing him inquisitively. Ryu\u2019s mouth drooled as he caught a glimpse of an odd fruit hanging from the trees. He hadn\u2019t eaten since\u2014well, he didn\u2019t know how long exactly, but enough time had passed that his stomach had begun to grumble and throb with a dull pain. He picked up the cat, setting it on his shoulder before crossing the river.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As he got closer, Ryu could make out the shape of the fruit. It was round\u2014red like an apple, yet slightly larger. He plucked one from the lowest branches, striking it against a nearby rock. Immediately, he recognized the fruit\u2019s white flesh, packed with glistening rubies. He scooped a handful of arils out of the pomegranate and tossed them in his mouth. Ryu closed his eyes, savoring the juicy seeds as they burst over his tongue.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cAh, now you\u2019re stuck here, nya.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ryu\u2019s head snapped around, searching for the speaker\u2019s location. \u201cW-who\u2019s there?\u201d he said shakily, holding out the pomegranate shell as if it were a weapon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cDown here, b***h.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ryu jumped for the second time that day, this time in shock as vulgarities escaped the mouth of the adorable creature.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cYou?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cYes, me. The name\u2019s Aurora. You crossed the river and ate the fruit. Looks like you\u2019re stuck here. But don\u2019t worry, nya. You saved me, so I\u2019ll stick with you in this land and lend you a hand.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ryu sank to the floor, defeated. He had officially lost his mind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cOh, no no no,\u201d he panicked. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get back home. I can\u2019t be hallucinating at a time like this,\u201d he said clutching his head.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cYou\u2019re not hallucinating, b***h,\u201d Aurora spoke. \u201cI\u2019m very real, and you\u2019re being disrespectful, nya.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWhere did you learn that? And can you stop calling me b***h? Cute things shouldn\u2019t speak like this!\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cHehe, very good. I am cute, aren\u2019t I? I\u2019ll forgive your transgressions then, bi\u2014eh, tell me, what is your name?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cRyu,\u201d he answered.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cVery well, Ryu. You\u2019re probably wondering where you are right now. You\u2019re not on Earth anymore. You drowned while trying to save me. Although since I\u2019m immortal, you unfortunately died in vain.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ryu couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me, right? I </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">am </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">crazy! Oh God, I have bills to pay. They\u2019re going to fire me for sure this time!\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cDid you hear me, you buffoon? You\u2019re dead. There is no job for you to go back to.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ryu suddenly paused in the middle of his mental breakdown. No job to go back to? Did that mean he had been transported to the afterlife? Were his days of turmoil behind him now? He looked around the forest, a dense thicket of trees with ripe fruit of all shapes and sizes. It was as if he had been transported to the Garden of Eden itself. He smiled, suddenly at ease, opting to lie in the grass. Ryu watched the clouds roll lazily above him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cEh, what are you doing?\u201d Aurora asked, poking him with a paw.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWhat does it look like? I\u2019m enjoying my time in the afterlife. Are there women here?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Aurora looked confused, shaking her head. \u201cI think you\u2019re mistaken, nya. This isn\u2019t the afterlife.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ryu raised an eyebrow. \u201cThen where are we?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWe\u2019re in Cerulia, just outside the walls of the Kingdom of Kaffa. I figured since you enjoyed making coffee so much I\u2019d do you a favor and resurrect you in this world.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ryu shot up from the ground. \u201cResurrect?! What about the afterlife and eternal bliss? What about the babes?!\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWell, you can find ladies anywhere, nya. I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so fixated on that single detail. The afterlife is open only for those who\u2019ve lived a fulfilling life. Most people get stuck in a cycle of rebirth </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">without </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">their memories, I might add. Be grateful, I kept your memories intact. They\u2019ll give you a </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">big </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">advantage here. Although I couldn\u2019t transfer your skills over. You\u2019ll need to learn those from scratch.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cMy skills? All I know how to do is make coffee.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Aurora grinned. \u201cExactly! That\u2019s all you\u2019ll need to know.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A worn-out-looking card manifested in front of Ryu. It floated elegantly into his outstretched hand. He read the description printed on one side.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[Coffee Brewer card for beginners. This card certifies that the carrier in question is a novice in coffee brewery]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A set of statistics appeared underneath the description.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[Current level: 0]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[Skills acquired: Pomegranate Infusion]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cHuh? Do I get skills from eating things?\u201d Ryu inquired.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cYep! Tasting all sorts of ingredients and working with different types of equipment will let you acquire skills that are added to your Knowledge Base. It isn\u2019t advisable to try every unknown item, however, because some are poisonous, nya,\u201d Aurora explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ryu shuddered. That was important to keep in mind. Otherwise, he would have started eating everything in sight to acquire more skills. He flipped the card, reading the backside.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[Adventurer card for beginners. This card signifies that the carrier in question is a novice in foraging and subjugation of local flora and fauna in the Wildlands]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[Current level: 0]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[Skills acquired: None]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Wildlands? \u201cHey, what is this exactly?\u201d he asked, pointing to the name of the area printed on the card.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cOh, it\u2019s quite simple really. Kaffa\u2019s economy thrives off of the resources found within this land. It spans for kilometers on end. The area is quite dangerous outside city walls, so only licensed adventurers are allowed to venture into the Wildlands and collect material from it.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ryu narrowed his eyes at the card. Perhaps this new life would prove to be more interesting than he thought. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cSo coffee is a big part of this kingdom\u2019s economy?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cYes! You\u2019ll find many like-minded individuals here. And if you become skilled enough in adventuring and brewing coffee, you could become a Royal Coffee Brewer of the King\u2019s Court! You\u2019ll be serving the king himself, nya.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ryu mulled it over. The prospect sounded lucrative enough. He knew his strengths when it came to coffee, but the adventuring aspect sounded dangerous. He preferred not to venture into parts unknown without someone more knowledgeable about the land at least. Maybe he could rely on improving his brewing skills first to make some money. Then he could hire a personal bodyguard from town. There were bound to be at least a few mercenaries at a local guild if this land was like any of the fantasy MMOs he played.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It was settled. Ryu was determined to make a name for himself in this odd world. The first order of business would be to acquire room and board. He could figure out a plan of action from there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cAurora, which way to the Kaffa Kingdom?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThis way!\u201d She scampered into the forest energetically. Seconds later, Aurora returned, however, making haste in the opposite direction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Ryu called after her, confused.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThe long way around, nya! You better start running!\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What was the issue? He turned around to figure out what had Aurora so frightened, instantly regretting his decision not to turn tail and follow after her. He stood face to face with an enormous hound, all three of its heads growling, their snouts scrunched up in a snarl.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That would be the issue.</span></p>\n            </div>",

Sure enough Junebug now had a [Mother] temporary tag floating in red over her head and five squirming puppies nuzzled up to her belly. The intensity of the red tag would fade as the pups grew and were eventually weaned.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, it seemed Junebug wasn't just prized for her foxhunting skills.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">She had somehow generated a class seed. An item that was so rare Alice had only recognized it from stories. Using one was one of the few ways to voluntarily change one\u2019s class.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Alice reached for the golden egg, which was shoved up against the opposite side of the wooden box away from the puppies. Her fingers hesitated a fraction of an inch from the shell.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">No. Skin-on-skin contact would activate it. Then she would never be able to sell it.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Glancing over her shoulder to make sure the [Kennel Manager] was nowhere near, she pulled the sleeve of her sweater over her hand. Then she grabbed the egg and shoved it into the front pocket of her apron.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">No need to worry about breaking the shell. This wasn't truly an egg. It only looked like one.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[Scholars] and [Priests] debated whether class seeds sprung into the world randomly or in a moment of need. Seeds famously generated in war-torn zones as if the System wanted to help soldiers in dire straits. As such, they were hard to destroy, but were incredibly easy to activate.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Her town wasn\u2019t exactly safe, but it was far from war-torn. Could it be the System generated it\u2026 for her?</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">No sooner had Alice hidden the egg, then she heard footsteps behind her.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Old Roy, the [Kennel Manager] stomped into view.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"Who's there? Oh, is that you Alice?\"</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"It's me,\" she confirmed. \"Just checking on Junebug.\"</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He snorted and stomped up to her. \"Well? She birthed yet?\"</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"Five pups so far,\" Alice said, quashing a spike of irritation that he didn\u2019t already know this.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Roy was the higher classer here, so he was in charge. But the hounds were so well-leveled that they were intelligent enough to not cause trouble. Roy had been coasting in his duties for years, leaving it up to unskilled [General Laborers] like Alice to take up the slack.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The only hope she\u2019d ever had to get a higher class was to show aptitude and hope the system would see and reward her. What she wouldn't give for a [Kennel Worker], [Animal Caretaker], or [Veterinarian Assistant] class. It was all she had ever dreamed of.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Alice didn't dare tell anyone this, of course. Nor did she allow any distaste for the smell of alcohol wafting off Roy to cross her face. The man had been in his office drinking again.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"By the way Junebug's panting, there may be a few more puppies coming,\" she said.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Roy grunted and looked over. \"You didn't touch none of the pups, girl?\"</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">She shook her head quickly and backed a step just in case he tried to take a swipe at her.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Roy narrowed his eyes, but either believed her or didn't care enough to push the issue. With a series of grunts and exaggerated grimaces, he maneuvered his large bulk into the straw-lined whelping box and reached to tap the puppies one by one.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As he did, the empty area over the newborn puppies\u2019 heads flashed with a [Common Hound] tag. That was a few ranks lower than Junebug's [Prize Hound] tag.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">From what Roy had claimed, the [Kennel Master] class gave random bonuses to newborn pups under his care.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Alice thought that might be a bunch of bunk. She\u2019d never seen a newborn [Prize Hound], nor any benefit from the ones Roy interacted with first.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"All worthless,\" Roy muttered, laboriously standing again.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Alice looked down at the tiny, squirming puppies. \"You don't know that. They might earn a better class, once they grow up a little.\"</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"Doubtful. You start as trash, you end as trash.\" Roy turned, unknowing or uncaring he was speaking to a [General Laborer] and stomped back to his office, and his drink.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As Alice watched him go, her hand slipped to touch over the lump in her apron pocket.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Most people started with the classes of one of their parents. That meant the families of [General Laborers] stayed [General Laborers]. Even noble's bastards only had a 50/50 shot of being a [Gentleman] or [Gentlewoman] as their starting class.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If someone worked hard, dedicated themselves to a single task, and the System was feeling generous that day... they might someday earn an upgraded class.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Or they could buy a Class Seed. Just like the one Alice had in her pocket. People paid fabulous amounts of money for one of these. Either way if she kept or sold it, her life was about to change forever.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"I won't stay trash forever,\" she muttered, but so quietly it was doubtful Junebug even heard her.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Through iron will, Alice kept from checking her pocket through the rest of her long day of chores.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">No employer of sense wanted to lose [General Laborer], which by law could be paid at lower rates than more specialized low classes. Even the [Gardeners] and [House Maids] had the class skills to earn higher pay and living conditions.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the stratified world of class hierarchies, the class meant everything.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">By design, Alice's duties were general and varied. A little of this, a little of that, so she would have a harder time specializing. That meant less of a chance she would ever earn a higher class. Some days she'd wash the outside windows or pull weeds in the garden. She\u2019d chop firewood or haul furniture out of the unused rooms for storage. Often she\u2019d turn around and haul that furniture right back in again, once the Earl\u2019s party was over.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">She tried to take all the time she could in the kennels, but when Roy caught her working there too often, she'd be sent to the washing rooms for a few weeks. That diluted her experience.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With a sigh, she activated her class sheet.</span></p>\n<div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow:auto\"><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong>Alice Turner</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Age: 19</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Class: General Laborer</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Level: 20</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Rank: 1</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Class Skills</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cleaning (Rank 1 25% bonus): Level 40</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">General Stamina (Rank 1 30% bonus): Level 37</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">General Strength (Rank 1 15% bonus): Level 35</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That short page was the sum total of her life\u2019s work. Her bottom-level class meant she was allowed three special skills. Those, of course, had been automatically assigned.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Eventually through the toil of years, she could move those skills to level 100 each. Then her class would upgrade. She\u2019d be eligible for another skill.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Not all classes were like this. Alice had heard rumors of marvelous benefits, of skills and ranks raining down on the children of those born to a lucky high class. [General Laborer] was at the bottom of the bottom, and most found it impossible to dig themselves out.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">All of which was the reason why the class-seed she found was so valuable.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Getting a new class would change the course of her life. But would she like that change?</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There were high-end [Merchants] who could tell her, but she was a [General Laborer] with virtually no status, no powerful friends to protect her, and no one to believe her if someone decided to take the seed for their own.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That made selling it tricky, though not impossible. There were auction houses with supposedly good reputations. She just had to find a way to safely find get to one, first.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Not an easy feat away from the protective estate walls.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Or she could use the seed herself. Change her own life. That was a risk, too. She had no idea what class this seed would grow into.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Alice had always loved animals, working with them, and taking care of them. She found it easier to deal with animal kind than humankind.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Yes, her life would improve if she became a [Seamstress], [Merchant], or [Politician], though none of those would make her happy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But would it be better than the life I have now?</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> She wondered.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">She doubted she\u2019d ever find another class-seed. And changing her class would be forever.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">She struggled with that question all through the day and found she still didn't have a firm answer by the time the sun went down at the end of her shift.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bone tired from a day of work, and mind weary from the weight of her decisions, Alice went back to her room.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">All [General Laborers] received housing as part of their pay. It wasn't much. An old, converted barn with the walls stuffed with straw to make it just warm enough for human beings to survive. The inside was sectioned out into individual cubicles. She shared hers with Dolly, another [General Laborer] her age.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Between herself and Dolly, they kept the cubicle clean. The Earl\u2019s [House Mage] came by to refresh cooling and heating charms on the walls to make the extreme ends of summer and winter bearable. While Alice shared the bathroom facilities with everybody else, she knew she lived better than some [General Laborers]. At least, that\u2019s what she told herself.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Alice's mind still turned over the question of what she was going to do with the class-seed. As such, she missed the warning signs from her roommate as she walked into their cubicle.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dolly had half of her clothing spread out across both beds. Unlike Alice, she spent most of her money \u2013 and resold gifts her lovers gave her \u2014 on expanding her outfits.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dolly\u2019s face was currently done up with expensive paints, and her black hair was tied up in curlers.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Alice stopped short, took in the sight of her roommate, then groaned. \"Oh Dolly, I thought we talked about this\u2026\"</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"Brandon </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">loves</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> me,\" Dolly sniffed. \"And I realized that, while you think your advice comes from a good place, you're also jealous.\"</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Carefully, Alice sat down on the very edge of her own bed \u2014 the only part not covered with clothing. \"Dolly,\" she said patiently. \"Brandon is a son of an Earl \u2014\"</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"Fourth son. He told me his father won't object to our marriage.\"</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Confrontation made Alice sick to the stomach, but Dolly was being stupid with her future. \"I\u2019ve heard he's gotten two of the [Chambermaids] pregnant this year\u2026\"</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dolly whirled on her. She had applied half her blush, making one cheek stand out much redder than the other. \"Those girls were </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">lying</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. They\u2019re taking advantage of his good nature!\"</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"Who told you that? Brandon?\"</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"He\u2019s Sir Brandon to you.\" The non-painted side of her face had gone red with anger, matching the other. \"Besides, if I get pregnant\u2026 Well, there\u2019s a chance the baby will have his class\u2026\"</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Alice couldn\u2019t believe she was being so stupid. \"It takes fourteen years to find out anybody's class. Dolly, have you\u2026 Has he\u2026\"</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">She couldn't finish, too mortified at the idea. Unwed single mother [General Laborers] were not treated kindly by society. Their value was in stolid, dependable work. That became difficult with a baby to look after.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"You are such a child.\" Dolly rolled her eyes and then turned to finish the rest of her makeup.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Alice wanted to talk some sense into her, but it felt like her throat had closed up. She\u2019d never been good with confrontation and she just knew Dolly would lash out at anything she said.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Alice hated herself but kept silent as the grave as Dolly finished getting ready. Judging by the amount of makeup she put on and the low-cut shirt, she planned an evening with Brandon.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dolly turned back once to look Alice up and down with a critical eye. \"You're not going to get anywhere unless you start taking chances. Do you want to be a [General Laborer] forever?\u201d</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI\u2014\"</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWell, think about it. Brandon has other brothers, and I suppose you're pretty enough to catch one\u2019s eye.\u201d</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Then she flounced out, brushing past the curtain that functioned as their door.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tears welled up in Alice's eyes. She quickly brushed them away.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Over the years, she had received some attention from other boys \u2013 even looks from noble heirs, but she didn\u2019t want romance. She wanted a better life.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And what had she done to get it? Skulked around the kennels and hoped that the System would someday notice and change her class. She was pathetic.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">She had the means to change her class, to change her life </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">right now</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, and she had been hesitant to even take it out of her pocket.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Alice liked to live a careful, considerate, quiet life. She knew she shouldn't let Dolly's words get to her, but\u2026 the other girl was right, wasn't she? People could work for a lifetime without the System offering a class change. To most, it was a pipe dream.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Meanwhile, if she decided to sell the class-seed and got swindled or the seed stolen\u2026 She would never forgive herself.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Maybe the System has seen me and this is its answer. I can change my life right now, and I don't need anybody else to do it.</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I just have to be brave enough to try.</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Any other class is better than [General Laborer].</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Alice got up, firmly yanked the curtain across the cubicle all the way shut, and then pulled out the egg-shaped seed with her bare fingers.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It activated in a flash of light.</span></p>\n            </div>",

It had taken her many weeks of travel to reach this place. An eerie purple glow emanated from the inner courtyard\u2014a sign that dark magic was present.</p>\n<p>The drawbridge was down, and when she stepped foot on its worn wood, the heavy portcullis started to slowly lift, granting her entry. Grinding chains echoed in the silence.</p>\n<p>She found the courtyard lit by sconces with flickering purple flames. The eerie light urged the shadows to dance across the empty stone.</p>\n<p>Marissa crossed the courtyard, heading straight for the keep. Its door swung open silently.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome in,\u201d a voice whispered through the halls.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello?\u201d Marissa asked. There was no response to her question, and with growing trepidation, she crossed the threshold into the keep.</p>\n<p>She was greeted by a tall, gaunt man with sunken eyes and pale skin. \u201cThe master has been expecting you,\u201d he said in a thin voice. \u201cPlease, follow me, and do not wander. There are many dangers in this castle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is?\u201d Marissa was taken aback by this. \u201cHow did he know I was coming?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have had eyes on you for the past week.\u201d The thin man turned and gave her a wan smile. \u201cNot many make the trek to this place, much less make it in one piece.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marissa felt a chill down her spine. She began to question the wisdom of coming here. Swallowing her fear, she followed the man in silence. He soon led her up a flight of winding stairs to a lone door. He knocked thrice in quick succession.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome in,\u201d a strong voice said from the other side.</p>\n<p>Opening the door, the thin man spoke, \u201cMy lord, I have brought you Marissa, as requested.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Matthew,\u201d the voice said.</p>\n<p>Marissa peered through the doorway. A man sat behind a desk made of bones. Matthew bowed and backed away.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, join me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marissa entered and asked quietly, \u201cAre you Ezekiel?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, yes I am.\u201d Ezekiel rose to greet her. He was tall, with pale skin and dark hair, and eyes that veritably glowed with purple magic. \u201cYou\u2019ve come a long way to see me, Marissa. I know why you\u2019re here, but I am not sure how much help I can be. That being said, you\u2019re welcome to stay, and I\u2019ll provide protection until you are safe again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marissa swallowed. \u201cThank you.\u201d A burden lifted off her shoulders as the constant fear she\u2019d been living with faded. She was officially under the protection of one of the most infamous players around. \u201cWhy are you willing to help me, though?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA couple of reasons.\u201d Ezekiel pulled a chair out for her and gestured for her to sit. \u201cThe first is, unlike many others currently, this happened to you unintentionally, like me. Secondly, I like to monitor people like us, and I knew of your case almost immediately. I did some looking into you and realized you are a cut above the rest, so I want to help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI see,\u201d Marissa took her seat as Ezekiel returned to his.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, how would you like to begin?\u201d Ezekiel smiled at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cI would like to hear your story,\u201d Marissa responded. \u201cMy hope is that I can gain some insight on what I need to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am not sure how much help that can be.\u201d Ezekiel steepled his fingers. \u201cEach journey like this is unique to the individual. But we shall try. Just be warned, it is a long story.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I brought this then.\u201d Marissa pulled out a magical quill and notepad; an item set she had from before which would help easily convey her thoughts to the pages.</p>\n<p>Marissa waited expectantly.</p>\n<p>Ezekiel chuckled, his deep gravelly voice rumbling. \u201cWell, I guess we can start now.\u201d</p>\n            </div>",

Ggonggi gungga!\u201d One pointed at a patch of grass, where an indistinct shape hid in the cover of the night\u2014prey.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cGgonggi!\u201d Another concurred.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cGgonggi ggangghek!\u201d The others turned to the one that spoke, staring quizzically, and it waved a hand dismissively. \u201cGungga.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The metal rubbing on old cloth whispered through the canopy as jagged daggers appeared in their hands, and dull thuds echoed down the tree, marking their descent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">By day, the large creature walked the plains with its herd, safe from all but the nastiest predators. Yet now, it was lost, isolated, alone, and forced to hide and hope nothing found it. No such luck.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One of the hunters rushed forth and stabbed the bovine in the stomach. It shrieked, joining the myriad nocturnal wails.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cGguggingo!\u201d One of the tiny creatures pointed at the throat aggressively, and the one that struck the stomach lifted its hands in panic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cGgonngi ggahara bong!\u201d Panicked, they rushed to silence the animal, and within moments, it perished.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Hissing, growling, roaring, and slithering could be heard in the darkness, approaching ever closer. They huddled together, and the group leader pointed at its feet and ahead, designating their escape route</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The sounds gradually quieted, acceding their dominance to distant echoes and silent whispers. The cloaked creature held its hand up while air coiled like a snake around their necks, and the temporal flow pulled the string taut, stretching without mercy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Crudely gloved fingers balled into a fist, which finally dropped. \u201cGgon!\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The instant they sprung down their evacuation route, dozens of beasts jumped out of the nearby grass and ran toward them. Colors flashed as maws lit up, claws burned, fur glowed, and eyes shone, all reflected in the thick layer of ice frozen by a slithering, indistinct beast.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mighty apes smashed the spines of felines, and several tiny creatures with sharp claws jumped them in turn, while a massive snake swallowed a shambling, rotten humanoid creature alive, and a gigantic, rotund monster with bladed arms jumped the snake, impaling its body.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cGgenggon!\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cGgarraggia!\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cGgeheroon!\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Several mighty predators stood in their way, and they scurried between them, using their tiny bodies to slither around the hefty blows of the walking calamities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cGgaggoi\u2014agaaargh!\u201d One was grasped in the jaws of a long-necked canine\u2014</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cGgohhuk\u2014\u201d and another was torn to shreds by claws.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One by one, but far fewer than they\u2019d been, they made it past the skirmish, breathing small, high-pitched sighs of relief as they reached relative safety\u2014</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Until a violent, nauseating noise sounded behind them, and they turned around to watch the gore and guts splatter over the plains.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cGgonggi, ggonggi!\u201d The leader pointed at a patch of out-of-view grass, and they immediately rushed into it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Groans and screams filled the area, and beasts dispersed, yet, few avoided being turned into piles of shredded meat.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The faint, blue light of the moonless sky lit the outline of a massive creature being grabbed by pitch-black arms and torn apart, limb by limb, as it desperately screamed and tried to free itself. It could muster barely a whimper as its head was gripped and, together with its spine, pulled straight off the battered torso to a gory splatter of crimson fluid.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Soon, the only screams that could be heard were far away, echoes of distant wars that did not concern them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Yet they dared not move.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The beast lifted its bony head, screeching with a sharp, bone-chilling whistle accompanied by a deep, reverberating clicking that abruptly turned to a brief silence\u2014which was soon interrupted by its thundering footsteps.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">They dared not breathe as the harrowing tread of nocturnal death grew louder.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The two thin legs supported its large, gangly body, and its arms looked too frail to possess such might. A piece of flesh hung on its crooked horn and melted, rotting at the touch of the vile mist, a billowing miasma that leaked through its skeletal face, void of eyes and ears, yet they knew.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It could hear and see better than any of them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It approached, reaching ever closer to the patch of grass they hid in.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A young one whimpered, and the leader gripped its arm with full strength, pulling it into a steel clasp as it slammed a palm to its mouth, praying to their gods that the creature hadn\u2019t heard them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The walking murder stepped before them, and they silently gazed upon the undead executioner. It paused, empty eye sockets facing the distant night, scouting the plains\u2014and before any of its tiny victims could react, swinging its hand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The bloody mist that had once been their leader and a young one signaled their failure to hide, and the others, panicked, scattered as the wild swings pulverized several more. More whistling and clicking filled the night as all life in the surrounding area ran from the reaper.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Extinguishing one spark after another, it slowly descended into the plains to seek bigger prey.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Stepping over guts and torn grass, the tiny creatures gathered, only able to count the living, as no corpse remained fully intact. They sagged despondently. Leader gone, losses many, food unacquired, and even the piles of gored flesh were already rotting at the slaughterer\u2019s touch.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So they waited, and the bestial screams went silent as the sunless sky cycled to cyan yet again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cGgegege gghar gghon gghigghihik!\u201d One of them whispered to its companion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Their dark green cloaks and wooden masks made them blend right into the mossy growth on the rock they were hiding behind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cGgehek gghinga, ggonging ggem ggeggeg!\u201d The other whispered back as it lifted its head to peek into the open passage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A portal was carved right into the surface of a nearby boulder. There were no signs that anything about the entrance was off besides the explicit cutoff from grassy plains to grey concrete.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A metal box of trash sat just past the entrance, and next to it was a withered door with an old sign on it: </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Greg\u2019s Burgers.</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The grass shuffled, and more of their companions gathered, their setback too heavy a blow to endure without drastic measures; they knew what they had to do.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It was time for an expedition into the unknown.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">***</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The metallic torture device shackled around Freddy\u2019s head signified the arrival of yet another unwelcome morning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The filthy sheets of his bed shifted, and with much effort, he freed his arm from the warm embrace of his covers to turn the crank on his headgear alarm. Round and round, it went, speeding up gradually as frustration overpowered his morning weakness.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The sound crystal vibrating inside grew brighter and eventually\u2014</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The mechanism triggered, the ear-grating ringing stopped, and he opened his eyes, greeting the depressing grey ceiling of his room, held up by the tight walls on each side. In the hole where his bed was, the walls were close enough that he could touch both without stretching his arms to their full length.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The only light source was the lick of sun peeking through his shades\u2014just enough to see where he was. Pulling the misery-inducing sleep annihilator off his head, he released his shoulder-length, greasy, black hair into a short-lived freefall and shuffled to the right, getting up from his bed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Luckily, he was of average height, for if he were any taller, he couldn\u2019t stand upright with the low ceiling. There already wasn\u2019t enough space to walk straight.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Scooting sideways to reach the window, he twisted the handle. It opened, allowing the sobering morning breeze in, carrying the smell of city-brand petrichor. Finally, with a lift of the hatch, the shades were pushed aside, and the full power of the morning sun, already shining over the tall buildings, entered his room.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The sky was particularly blue today, and the clouds of yesterday\u2019s rain still hung on the horizon, journeying to distant lands. Glittering reflections scattered off the floating buildings to the right and jumped off the rooftop puddles everywhere else.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cFuck this shit, man,\u201d Freddy groaned. \u201cWhy do I gotta work today?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The small studio apartment, or as Freddy preferred to call it, the dungeon cell he lived in, was an old, tiny, cramped living space\u2014and the only home he had.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The basket with his clothes hung off the low ceiling above his \u2018closet,\u2019 an old, broken chest repurposed for keeping his things out of sight. It wasn\u2019t that big, yet it occupied the lion's share of his room, leaving but a tight, L-shaped path from his bed to the door.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Picking his work clothes out of the basket, the white shirt, black pants, and red vest, he took a whiff of their stench as he brought them up to and away from his face.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He raised an eyebrow. \u201cRancid up close, but unnoticeable from a distance,\u201d nodding, he concluded, \u201cthey\u2019ll last through the day.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">After draping the uniform over the window and praying they aired out some of the stink, he took another step over a stool and entered the \u2018kitchen\u2019 part of his room.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It was a fridge cramped between the garbage can and the entrance to his apartment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Freddy dragged the stool over in front of the fridge. Opening and bumping the refrigerator door into the chest, he found the stale bologna sandwich he had half-eaten yesterday. Closing the fridge again, he pulled the chair closer and sat on it, using the small cooler as a table.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">His seat was low, and he didn\u2019t have the space to sit straight, so he ate head pushed sideways, just barely past the ground.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Once he was done quickly gulping it down, he gathered the crumbs into his hand and threw them into the trash.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He took his clothes off the window and a toothbrush from a glass on the fridge, put his slippers on, squeezed between the cooler and the chest, and left his apartment, still in his old pajamas. The moment he opened the door, his stomach dropped.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">His neighbor, an overweight middle-aged man with a massive mustache, was chatting with an older brunette woman outside the toilet. The young man instantly looked at the clock on the wall above the bathroom.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">6:43 AM</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fright turned to anger, and he marched to confront his neighbor. \u201cJames, what the hell, man!\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The older man jumped back slightly, turning to face him. \u201cOh\u2026 hey Fred!\u201d The man slightly leaned back. \u201cWhat\u2019s got you bothered?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Freddy waved his hands and lightly shoved the older man toward the bathroom. \u201cGet in the toilet and hurry up! I\u2019m next on the schedule!\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The man waved him down. \u201cRelax, nobody will get on your back for being a bit slow today. It\u2019s the two-hundredth anniversary!\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI\u2019ll be late to </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">work!</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201d Freddy declared, accenting the final part of the statement to make sure it sank in.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWork?\u201d The man frowned. \u201cHahaha, you don\u2019t mean\u2026?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Freddy's tired, angry glare answered that question.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The older man awkwardly coughed as he shuffled into the toilet, hurriedly closing the door behind him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Freddy waved weakly at the older woman still outside, doing his best to put on a pleasant expression. \u201cHello, Sharon.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cHey there, Fred,\u201d she returned the greeting amicably. \u201cHow unpleasant that you have to work today! I\u2019d quit if I were you.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cOh, believe me, hahaha\u2026\u201d Freddy laughed lightly. \u201cI\u2019d quit too.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">She chuckled and turned around, waving him goodbye. \u201cBye, Fred! Have a good one! Hope they don\u2019t hold you up too long!\u201d Just as she was about to rush up the stairs, she paused and turned to him. \u201cHey, you could join James and I for drinks tonight if you don\u2019t mind!\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThanks for the offer, but I think I\u2019ll pass,\u201d he declined politely. \u201cBye, Sharon.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cA shame! I assume you already have plans, then. Well, have fun!\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">His wave dropped into a light slap on his thigh, and he leaned against the wall as she disappeared up to the third floor of the building.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2018Plans, huh\u2026?\u2019</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As the clock ticked, Freddy heard his neighbor singing in the shower. His foot impatiently bounced on the ground, and he gritted his teeth a bit harder every time a minute passed.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">6:48</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">6:49</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">6:50</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That marked the start of his turn, yet, he could still hear the water running. </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">6:51</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">6:52</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">6:53\u2014</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The door unlocked, and just as James was about to apologize for taking his time, Freddy rushed past him and locked the doors. He glanced at the toilet, angrily squeezing his buttcheeks. Looks like he\u2019d have to crap on his break again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Freddy undressed so swiftly that he heard a slight tear from his pajamas. Into the shower he went, pouring the barely-lukewarm water, despite being turned to the maximum temperature, over his body.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At the very least, the landlord provided clean towels daily, one per person, neatly stacked on a pile. Sadly, the shitty people that lived in this complex frequently helped themselves to more than one, leaving the last few on schedule with a pile of damp, stinky cloth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Even he wasn\u2019t entirely spared by this. Once, he grabbed a used towel and, sadly, ran into the part someone used to dry their genitals, wiping his face with it. Thankfully, as he was on the day shift again, he would be spared such a fate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">After drying himself and angrily wrapping the towel around his head, he walked to the mirror. He paused once he got a good look at himself. Relatively recently, he had turned twenty-one. Hard to believe.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Be it the stress, or the acne scars that spread over his face and body, he looked aged and weathered. His black hair, draping down the sides of his head, complemented the deep bags beneath his dark brown eyes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There was no time to ponder his looks. Nor did he care about them. In his opinion, there was no such thing as being \u2018ugly.\u2019 Only poor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Toothpaste on brush, brush into mouth, and a short, furious scrub later, he was dressing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Buttoning the white shirt and pulling the black pants up, he combed his still somewhat wet hair to the side and donned the red vest with the store logo. After hearing knocking on the bathroom door, he gave one last regretful look to the toilet and rushed out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Back in his apartment, he grabbed his keys and opened the fridge, taking out the cheap cold brew coffee he had prepared the night before, one of the only luxuries he could afford, and running it through a filter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI sure hope I don\u2019t shit myself.\u201c</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Usually, if he were late to the toilet, he would simply run to work. His clothes were already starting to smell, so if he ran today, he\u2019d get fired for stinking like ass.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Putting the coffee on the fridge, he bent over to open the chest and grabbed his brown boots, replacing the slippers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Coffee in hand, he squeezed past the chest and the fridge again, left, locked his apartment, and walked out of the building at a measured pace, taking steady steps down the staircase to avoid spilling his coffee.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Pulling the door open, he stepped outside and\u2014</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cUwoah!\u201d Freddy jumped back as a large drake nearly flattened him. The asshole riding the green lizard didn\u2019t even register his existence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Luckily, the coffee wasn\u2019t spilled on his shirt, so Freddy merely breathed a sigh of relief and walked out. Shooting a glance at the prick who rode away without a care in the world, he scoffed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He didn\u2019t let the disturbance throw him off-kilter. The jumpscare did hasten his heartbeat, but thankfully, it wasn\u2019t enough to make him sweat. Thus, he continued his daily ritual as he started the thirty-minute trek to his workplace.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There wasn\u2019t much traffic this early, especially not in his district. The dilapidated, pothole-ridden road he walked on held a few shallow puddles, and Freddy made sure not to step into any.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The usual carriages, pulled by more drakes, made their way slowly down the road, avoiding the holes so they wouldn\u2019t break a wheel.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To his immense surprise, Freddy had to dodge a splash when a self-driving carriage blazed by him. You didn\u2019t see those too often around here, but judging by its direction, it wasn\u2019t too surprising.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The disappearance of the potholes marked the entry into the twenty-third district, and Freddy glanced at the relatively new buildings with envy. Although few archs lived here, shops still sold weapons, mostly civilian grade, for self-defense.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cafes were already pulling their chairs outside, and music could be heard from multiple sources. The sound of crystals designed for purposes besides ear violation was much more pleasant than the war crime that woke him up every morning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Eventually, the clean but ordinary road was replaced by shiny marble paving. As Freddy stepped into the twenty-fifth district, he began the most controversial part of his daily routine. On good days, he would admire it. On bad days, he would plot a fantasy terrorist attack in his head.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Floating structures, islands, platforms, colorful bridges leading from one tall building to another, expansive, gravity-defying balconies, and vast yards, some in the shape of floating, spinning balls, resembling miniature planet gardens, were only some of the things in his vicinity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The shiny white castle on a floating island way up in the sky, the ring building to its left, and the tower that rose taller than both the floating structures were even more impressive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The wealthiest district in his entire city was a collection of powerful archs\u2019 and their family members\u2019 homes, which were likely archs themselves, probably with talents they were wasting with their far-from-danger lifestyles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Exotic plants pulled from passages grew everywhere, likely as a dick-measuring contest between the residents. For over half the houses here, Freddy had never seen a single person inside or outside, which likely meant that they were some wealthy arch\u2019s second, third, or fourth, or whatever house.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As he stepped into the district, he spotted the carriage that nearly splashed him a few minutes ago. Several large men pulled heavy metallic fences from the inside of the carriage, which was likely bigger than it seemed from the outside.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Freddy smirked at the pointy spikes lining the surface of the fences.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2018Someone\u2019s renovating their fuck-you-poors decorations, I see? Good for them.\u2018</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Taking a sip of coffee, he walked onward, and eventually, another one of the carriages overtook him, stopping near the district's edge on the other side. Yet again, burly men pulled the same type of fence out of the carriage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Freddy raised an eyebrow at that. Influential people hated feeling like someone was copying them. That likely wasn\u2019t the case, though. Some rich bastard was probably making a long ass fence in the sky or splitting the district in half.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2018Yo, I heard you like segregation, so I put segregation in your segregation!\u2019</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Freddy chuckled a bit, and the workers shot him a glance. Walking past the men, he waved at them awkwardly. He finished the final sip of his coffee and threw the single-use cup into a garbage can.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Once he was out of the district, he immediately took a sharp turn right and walked through tight paths between the buildings to the place where he worked.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It was a medium-sized store in the twenty-fourth district where he had been working for over eight years. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Charat Hypermarket, </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the sign said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He walked past the \u2018special offer\u2019 signs that he had placed himself yesterday and entered the massive store.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">After greeting the manager, he walked to the cash register. They were one of the few stores that worked today, and people loved forgetting small things until the last minute. If the dozens of people inside were a sign of things to come, today would be a long-ass day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">***</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Although it could sometimes be tiring, Freddy didn\u2019t always hate his job. The twelve-hour shifts were a pain, but he had no life outside of work anyway. The noon lull struck, and Freddy caught a moment to breathe.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A large, rectangular broadcasting crystal hung off the wall a bit away from the cash registers. It was angled awkwardly, but he could see everything on it without much problem, even though he had to strain his ears to hear the sound.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A finely dressed reporter was talking about the anniversary. Freddy always found it a little morbid that it had ever become a celebrated holiday. Well, he was sure those in power today appreciated the sacrifice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cHey! Young man!\u201d A middle-aged lady angrily marched over to his cash register, and he groaned internally.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2018Oh, boy, here we go.\u2018</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cYou have billed me wrongly! Thief!\u201d The woman screamed, pointing an accusatory finger at him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cCalm down, madam,\u201d Freddy placated the woman. \u201cPlease, show me your receipt.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With a smug, self-satisfied expression, the woman pulled the receipt out of her bag and shoved it aggressively into his face. \u201cYou\u2019ve billed me twice for the napkins!\u201d</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2018I\u2019ll be damned, so I did.\u2019</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The deepening frown on his only widened the grin on her face.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI apologize, Mrs. Allow me to fix my mistake.\u201d Freddy gave the woman his well-trained, apologetic, and polite smile as he reached for the bag in her hands.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cHold on there, what are you doing!?\u201d The woman clutched at her groceries and took a step back.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cOh, I apologize,\u201d Freddy withdrew, \u201cbut I have to count everything up again to refund you.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The woman looked peeved at that but, to Freddy\u2019s shock, managed to control her temper and wait the half a minute it would take him to scan everything.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There was no real way to prove the woman didn\u2019t just buy two sets of napkins and hide one. As a veteran in this business, however, he knew how the company dealt with such situations. The odds of catching a petty thief in action weren\u2019t high enough to justify the risk of losing a paying customer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Which was why the customer was always right.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One item after another went past the inscribed metal scanner, and the total price showed on the tiny crystal to his right.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Freddy frowned and sucked air through his teeth. \u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It was </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">more, </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">not less than before.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">His heart sank when he compared the receipt to the itemized list on the screen. \u201cAh, I apologize\u2026 Mrs, but uh\u2026 I, haha\u2026 I seem to have scanned the napkins twice instead of scanning the cookies twice. That\u2026 will be\u2026 another two dollars.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Expression cooling, back straightening, arms crossing\u2026</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2018Oh, for fuck\u2019s sake.\u2019</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">***</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The small line of people watched the manager lambast Freddy for a few minutes, and the woman was given a coupon for the inconvenience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Freddy rushed to apologize when the woman walked out, but the manager waved him off, whispering to ensure none of the customers could hear him and speaking fast as he was in a hurry, \u201cYou have a good record, don\u2019t worry, I get it, mistakes happen, I won\u2019t dock it from your pay or anything,\u201d the manager told him and ran off in a rush. \u201cKeep your eyes open, and don\u2019t do that again.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cOh\u2026 okay.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That didn\u2019t make it any less stressful\u2026 or embarrassing. The next annoying, rude bastard rushed over before he had the time to recover, pulling tens of cans of beer out of the shopping cart.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This would be a long day, indeed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">***</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">After spending fifteen damn minutes waiting for Jenny, the chronically late night-shift worker, to take over, he finally headed home.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">His hand gripped the plastic bag holding the can of beans that would be his dinner tonight, and he walked on, leaving another exhausting workday behind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Muffled, loud music could be heard from many directions, and Freddy couldn\u2019t help but feel particularly lethargic today.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2018The two-hundredth anniversary, huh\u2026?\u2019</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll cut loose for the three-hundredth one, hahaha,\u201c he joked, but a considerable part of him was serious.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Perhaps that was why people celebrated the Rift. The possibility of living to see something a hundred years in the future would have been an incredible privilege for anyone two hundred years back.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sighing profoundly and keeping his head down, Freddy reached the opulent twenty-fifth district. The moment he approached the turn, he had to stop immediately.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cUh-oh,\u201c he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There was a fence. And it was blocking the path through the district. Freddy could feel a headache setting in, but he calmed himself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A man walked up to the fence and casually jumped over it as if it weren\u2019t there, startling Freddy slightly. Looking to the right, he spotted a short line of people looking to get in and a guard letting them through.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2018Just keep it calm, Fred. You got this.\u2019</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The line went by rather swiftly, and soon enough, Freddy waved at the guard and tried walking through, but the man stopped him immediately. \u201cPlease provide verification or confirmation that you have business inside.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Freddy tried playing dumb.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThis is a private district. Mortals aren\u2019t allowed entry without permission.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2018Fucking what!? Since when!?\u2019 </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Freddy raged in his mind, but none of that showed outwardly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With a polite smile, Freddy scratched his head and chuckled awkwardly. \u201cOh, hahaha, sorry, sorry, I am going to a party tonight, so can you just let me through?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cPlease provide a ticket or name of the person that invited you,\u201d the guard requested as he pulled a list out of his suit, and Freddy bit his lip.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cHis name is John.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The guard raised an eyebrow. \u201cJohn, who?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cJohn\u2026 Smith.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cNobody by the name of John Smith is expecting guests.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI\u2019m not a guest, I\u2019m a\u2026 uh\u2026 an en\u2014ter\u2014tainer? Yeah, I\u2019m a dancer. Of a, you know\u2014\u201d Freddy waved his hands around his torso. \u201c\u2014special kind.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cSir, I will have to ask you to step away.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">People gathered behind Freddy, and he made a last-ditch effort, \u201cInsolent! Do you have any idea who my father is!?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Glancing at the beans swinging in the bag Freddy carried in his hands, the guard gave him a flat look, then gently but firmly pushed him to the side.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2018Fuck!\u2019 </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He screamed internally as he hesitantly turned around, tightening the grip on the bag in his hand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A few people in line laughed at him, but that was far from Freddy\u2019s biggest problem.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Biting his fist in frustration, Freddy walked away from the gathering crowds and sat on a small wall. He wasn\u2019t here for sightseeing. He had to go home! Glancing to the left of the Bastard Barricade, then to the right, he felt himself shaking a little, and he had to swallow a lump in his throat.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It was already nearly 8 PM. The twenty-fifth district wasn\u2019t that big, but it was a different story if he had to walk </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">all the way around it. </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If he went left through the rest of the twenty-fourth district, where he was currently located, he would have to add </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">another forty minutes</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to his daily routine, both </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">to and from </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">work. That was nearly another hour and a half! With his work time, he barely had three hours of free time a day, and his chores devoured most of that! Even that night, he was supposed to head to the damn laundromat to wash his clothes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Taking deep breaths and clenching the bag, Freddy murmured into his chin, \u201cCalm down, Freddy. You got this.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He could also go right, adding barely another ten minutes to the walk. Now, as a victim of classism, Freddy wasn\u2019t a big fan of it... but right\u2026 That was </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the bad </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">part of the city.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The twenty-sixth district was quite firmly walled off from the twenty-fifth. And that simple wall hop made all the difference in the world. Freddy was allowed to say that, given he used to live there. He knew from experience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It wasn\u2019t like he\u2019d get robbed for walking through it once, but walking there every day was practically asking for it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWhatever\u2026\u201d</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Freddy got up and walked right.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What robbery? The only thing of any value on his person was a damn can of beans. And he\u2019d rather lose a kidney or two than walk home for over an hour. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As he proceeded, it wasn\u2019t long until the sounds of music grew more distant and muffled. The exact line that separated the twenty-sixth district was obvious, given that that\u2019s where the street maintenance ended.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ragged roads, worn-out buildings, and trash lining the corners reminded Freddy of a bittersweet part of his life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lots of people walked the streets. Teens gathered in every corner, and loud talking could be heard everywhere. He couldn\u2019t help but feel bad for his earlier thinking. All he saw here were people having fun and living their best lives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He kind of missed the vibe of the place, but that didn\u2019t make him regret moving out. Especially after he ran into a group of three drunk, shirtless men that hugged him, grabbed the bag of beans out of his hands, and ridiculed him, screaming \u2018boy got beans\u2019 and the like.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thankfully they returned his food, and Freddy went on his way. Beans wouldn\u2019t be on the menu for a while again. Eventually, Freddy reached a turn and took another quick shortcut.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cOh, yeah, this is where Greg\u2019s place used to be.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">His parents used to take him there when he was little. Which was yet another reason not to walk this route.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Walking through the relatively narrow space between the buildings, he noticed someone had left their doors open. Freddy was somewhat taken aback by how </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">bright </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the inside of that place was.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The doors were massive, and the light was far from natural. Some part of him screamed that something was wrong, but he was too tired to put two and two together.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It was only as he walked past it, turning his head and reflexively violating the privacy of the supposed apartment owners, that he realized this was no home at all.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">His grip on the grocery bag tightened, and his legs froze.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The entire world spun as he stepped in front of the portal leading onto an open field of golden grass. </span></p>\n            </div>",

There weren't many people around this early in the morning, which was both a blessing and a curse. It kept him from running into familiar faces that might want to offer sympathy, but it also meant he was alone with his thoughts \u2013 which at the moment, made for poor company.<br><br>He almost regretted heading out today. If not for the fact that staying inside his claustrophobic, foul-smelling dorm room was more a disheartening prospect than leaving, Adam probably would\u2019ve resigned himself to a day in bed. Unfortunately, his housing situation was sketchy enough that he'd basically forced himself outside in order to keep his sanity and sense of smell.<br><br>Problem was, he really didn\u2019t have many options for where to go. It had to be somewhere off campus, so that he wouldn\u2019t run into any sympathetic faces, and it couldn\u2019t be anywhere that cost money. There just weren't any good places for him to wander to.<br><br>Which is why he settled for a <em>bad</em> place, instead.<br><br>An antiquated, run-down store stood proudly in front of him, like a wrinkled storyteller with a lifetime of experiences to share. Adam was no stranger, having visited it twice a week for the past two years since getting into art school.<br><br>This visit would be more bittersweet than usual. He barely had any money left to buy supplies, but maybe going there would clear his mind a little. And just as importantly, he wouldn\u2019t meet anyone he knew there. The art store wasn\u2019t exactly...upscale. To Adam's more spoiled classmates, it was shady as all hell.<br><br>To him, though, it was cheap and within walking distance.<br><br>Not that he\u2019d tell its shopkeeper that. \u201cWhatcha here for this time, Adam?\u201d the old, friendly man asked, without turning around. He would often be up on a ladder that was just too small, trying to reach a shelf for some reason or another. \u201cNeed more brushes? Ink? Canvases?\u201d<br><br>Adam didn\u2019t <em>need</em> any of those. He wanted them, of course, but he didn\u2019t have the money to waste and he couldn\u2019t justify it when his degree was focused on digital art. His tablet was enough \u2013 unless his classes demanded otherwise.<br><br><em>Which they will. And I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to pay for that.</em><br><br>\u201cNot right now. I just...\u201d Adam paused, searching for an excuse to be there. \u201cHave to draw something soon. Was hoping to look at the local paintings for inspiration.\u201d<br><br>Still atop the ladder, the old man looked around to raise an eyebrow at him. \u201cWhat, got a contest coming up or something? Didn\u2019t you just get done with another one?\u201d<br><br>Adam felt his fist tighten at the memory. \u201cJust finished it.\u201d<br><br>\u201cToo bad you didn\u2019t win. Really thought you had that one.\u201d<br><br><em>So did I. Wouldn\u2019t have spent three weeks barely sleeping to work on it otherwise. That goddamn prize money...I was right there. I <strong>earned</strong> it.</em><br><br>He did his best to clear his thoughts. It wouldn\u2019t do good to focus on that, and it was too soon, anyway. His face was still aching from the punch he\u2019d gotten afterward \u2013 not that the physical pain was going to be what lasted longest.<br><br>\u201cIt was close,\u201d Adam said, faking a smile. \u201cBut sometimes things don\u2019t end up the way you want.\u201d<br><br>\u201cAt least your friend won it, didn\u2019t he?\u201d<br><br>\u201cYeah. Eric did.\u201d<br><br>\u201cGood \u2013 always stings less if a friend wins instead of some random fuckwit, eh?\u201d The old man barked out a hoarse laugh. \u201cI\u2019m going to be organizing things for a while. Just go to the back and take as much of a look as you want.\u201d<br><br>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll be careful.\u201d<br><br>\u201cDon\u2019t even bother. Most of what\u2019s there is worthless.\u201d<br><br>Adam allowed himself a sardonic laugh. \u201cWouldn\u2019t have thought a guy who keeps a local art shop would have that mindset. What happened to the good ole' adage of \u2018Art is about more than just popularity?\u2019 What about their meaning, or how beautiful they are?\u201d<br><br>The Old Man snorted. \u201cPff. They fail in that regard too. They\u2019re ugly, dirty...falling apart. Most of them aren\u2019t even originals, just copies of unknown paintings that no one wanted. Can you believe that? A copy of a failure.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhy do you keep them around, then?\u201d<br><br>He shrugged. \u201cSomeone has to. Might as well be me.\u201d<br><br>\u201cAnd I might as well be the one to try and get some inspiration out of them,\u201d Adam said, grinning.<br><br>\u201cDo as you wish.\u201d<br><br>Adam pushed aside a purple curtain behind the counter \u2013 and started coughing before he\u2019d even turned the lights on. <em>I just cleaned this place for him last week. How the hell is it already dusty?</em><br><br>Although, if he was being honest, it wasn\u2019t something that upset him. He appreciated the distraction. Anything was better than thinking about that competition and how he <em>should</em> have won, how everything would be better now if only\u2013<br><br>He shook his head and retrieved his drawing tablet from his backpack. <em>Gotta focus. Work is the best antidote for sorrow.</em><br><br>The Old Man may have been a bit harsh when judging his paintings, but he also hadn\u2019t been unfair. Most of them were downright ancient, painted on dusty canvases that looked like they were dirty before any paint ever dried on them. A few were torn, as if they\u2019d been attacked with knives.<br><br>\u201cI almost feel sorry for them,\u201d Adam muttered, shifting through the loosely-arranged paintings. \u201cEven copies of failures deserve better than this.\u201d<br><br>He decided to clean up a little, brushing off clumps of dust as he went. It felt nice to do something for someone. Gave him a sense of purpose when he sorely needed it. He continued for several minutes, spending more time on cleaning than looking at any of the paintings.<br><br>It wasn't long before his thoughts returned to keep him company again. Adam passed the time with fantasies of quitting art school, the option growing more appealing the longer he considered it. On a normal day he would\u2019ve gone on with his quiet cleaning for a few hours, told the Old Man he couldn\u2019t find anything too inspiring, then headed home.<br><br>If not for that one painting.<br><br>\u201cHas this always been here?\u201d Adam muttered to himself. \u201cI don\u2019t <em>think</em> so. Would\u2019ve noticed last time. It\u2019s kind of hard to miss.\u201d<br><br>Among those dusty paintings from a bygone era, there was one that stood out. It was hanging on the wall, illuminated by a single weak light positioned above it, and encased in a thick metal frame that looked far more expensive than anything else Adam had ever seen at the store. He blinked a few times before studying the painting in closer detail. <em>Did I seriously miss this the last couple times I was here? No, this has got to be new.</em><br><br>The strange thing was, Adam couldn\u2019t seem to remember it being there when he'd started cleaning. <em>Guess I'm more out of it than I thought.</em> <em>I must be crazy to have missed this.</em><br><br>How else could he have overlooked a painting this beautiful and haunting?<br><br>It portrayed a mighty stone castle, the colors appearing like a sort of everlasting abyss that had befallen that world. Yet the painting itself was not dark, depicting a foggy white light bursting out from behind the castle and beneath the rock cliff, creating an impression of a frigid, misty morning. Blue was its primary color, Adam noticed, and that hue only added to the sensation of chilling cold he felt upon looking at it.<br><br>There was no snow anywhere on the painting, but that blueish fog \u2013 so dark it neared black \u2013 and the whiteness touching it all combined to create a feeling of isolation he couldn\u2019t quite place. Above the castle there were birds, ruling the skies above them as they faded into the misty morning sun. And at the very bottom of the picture was a simple man, draped in shadow and lacking in detail, gazing up at the castle of grandeur and seeming all too insignificant before it.<br><br>The painting wasn\u2019t a particularly skillful piece of art. Adam recognized most of the techniques used \u2013 he could probably paint something like that himself. But there was <em>something</em> about the way that lonely painting stood out, alone amongst a gallery of misfits, which caught his attention.<br><br>Maybe it was his stress from the competition.<br><br>Maybe it was his lack of sleep.<br><br>Maybe it was simply how overwhelmed he felt at the moment.<br><br>Whatever his reason was, Adam felt compelled to reach out and touch the painting, despite knowing that doing so could damage it. There was a childlike wonder pushing him forward, as if a part of him wondered if he would get sucked into the painting the moment his fingers grazed it.<br><br>He was even more surprised when that actually happened.<br><br>Adam had spent enough time daydreaming near paintings to imagine what it would feel like in a thousand different ways \u2013 and all of them were wrong. It wasn\u2019t like an invisible hand that grasped his wrist and pulled him through a portal. Instead, the first thing he felt was that air was no longer entering his lungs. Adam barely avoided panicking, thinking maybe that the shock had merely caught his breath. That was when he realized, to his horror, that the lack of air in his lungs didn\u2019t even feel uncomfortable.<br><br><em>Keep calm, </em>he thought. <em>If I can make my way to the old man, he\u2019ll call for an ambulance.</em> He tried to take a step forward \u2013 and couldn\u2019t. His feet wouldn\u2019t budge. When he glanced down, he instantly knew why.<br><br>His legs were dissolving.<br><br>Small bubbles, so small that perhaps particles was a more fitting word, were floating away from his body. It was a constant stream of <em>parts of him</em> floating from his body and into the painting. And it was more than just his legs \u2013 every bit of his body had started to dissolve in the same way.<br><br>Frantic, inane thoughts filled his mind, but before he could process any of them, he saw something that made him stop. The particles weren\u2019t bubbles; they were <em>pigments. </em>Every atom in his body was being transformed into paint, then floating into that beautiful portrait of a castle flanked by cliffs.<br><br>It was as if the entire room around him had been turned into a canvas. Slowly, drop by drop, his body was leaving this world. Adam's mouth opened and he felt the sensation of his jaw moving, but nothing came out. His voice \u2013 his screams \u2013 were silenced.<br><br>Soon, even minor movements became impossible, his body refusing to cooperate with his attempts to escape. Adam could do nothing except continue to stare ahead. The painting grew larger every second, almost like it was coming closer to him. It couldn\u2019t have been more than a few moments, but to him it felt longer than an eternity.<br><br>And when he came to his senses, he was falling.<br><br>Time ceased to exist. Direction was meaningless. He was falling, falling, falling, into an endless void of darkness, devoid of up and down.<br><br><strong>WHAT IS THE COLOR OF YOUR SOUL?</strong><br><br>The voice came from nowhere and everywhere at once. At first Adam felt it had originated from inside his head, but that couldn\u2019t be right. If that were the case, then it wouldn\u2019t feel like his entire body was <em>shaking</em> when the vibrations of sound bounced off his flesh. Had there been solid ground beneath his feet, Adam would have fallen to his knees.<br><br>Lacking so much as footing, he spun around in the endless void, hoping to regain some measure of balance. His momentum never stopped. With every desperate movement Adam only spun faster.<br><br><strong>WHAT IS THE COLOR\u2014OF\u2014YOUR\u2014SOUL?</strong><br><br>Adam immediately stopped spinning, as if inertia itself felt scared of the voice. Panicked thoughts came to him \u2013 and he discarded them all. Something deep inside him knew that if he did anything but answer, right now, his life would end then and there.<br><br>\u201cI...don\u2019t know,\u201d Adam managed to say. His lips didn\u2019t move, but he still heard his own voice loud and clear. \u201cI have no idea what that means.\u201d<br><br><strong>THE WORLD IS STAINED. WHAT COLOR WILL YOUR SOUL PAINT OVER IT?</strong><br><br>The void descended into a kaleidoscope of colors that flanked Adam from all directions. There were colors he was used to, like red, blue, and green, but there were also colors he\u2019d never seen before. Colors he couldn\u2019t even begin to comprehend.<br><br>And he was supposed to pick <em>one </em>of them? When his sense of reality had been ripped from his consciousness? It was more than unfair; it was impossible<em>. </em>He was a bad artist, but an artist nonetheless.<br><br>Picking just one felt like a crime.<br><br>\u201cI\u2019m not a color,\u201d Adam declared. \u201cI\u2019m a <em>painter</em>.\u201d<br><br><strong>YOU ARE? </strong>The voice appeared amused. <strong>FINE.</strong><br><br>And so Adam started falling once more.<br><br>\u2013<br><br>His eyes crept open.<br><br>Adam\u2019s first thought upon waking was to check his backpack. There was no way he could afford another drawing tablet. His heart skipped a beat when he located his shattered cellphone first. Just as his anxiety was about to overwhelm him, Adam let out a euphoric, almost manic laughter when he found that his tablet was miraculously untouched. Somehow, despite falling from hundreds of feet above the air, the screen didn\u2019t have so much as a scratch on it. That was some damn good luck.<br><br>It was only when he heard his own voice that he realized that <em>he</em> hadn\u2019t been hurt either. And that he was able to breathe again. At the time, those concerns had seemed secondary.<br><br><em>I don\u2019t have any broken bones. Nothing even hurts. It\u2019s like I didn\u2019t fall from the sky at all.</em><br><br>He\u2019d been willing to accept getting hurt. Broken bones were expensive, but you could get the treatment done and deal with the debt later. Equipment was much harder to finance. Still, Adam was definitely relieved that he wouldn\u2019t have to make his next bank statement any more frightening to look at. Not having to drag himself toward an ambulance was a win, too.<br><br>On second thought, now that he looked at his surroundings, Adam wasn\u2019t even sure where he even would've gone to find a road. He was in the middle of what appeared to be an extremely dense forest, which made his fall all the more puzzling. The trees were tall enough to block out most of the sun, allowing only small, filtered bits of faint light to illuminate the area. It was dark enough that Adam had to pay close attention to confirm it was daytime.<br><br>There was no forest anywhere <em>near</em> his college town. And how come he didn\u2019t remember hitting those trees on his way down? None of this was adding up.<br><br>Maybe he hadn\u2019t fallen after all. <em>Could be I was drugged somehow, </em>he reasoned. <em>That\u2019d make more sense \u2013 the old man always did have some weird stuff at his shop. If this whole thing is just one hell of a trip, that would explain everything.</em><br><br>It was a rational, logical explanation. Adam still couldn\u2019t make himself believe it. Everything around him felt entirely too real, and his mind was perfectly clear. There was no delay between his thoughts, no irrational leaps from one point to another. This didn\u2019t feel like he\u2019d been drugged; if anything, he felt more awake than he had been in months.<br><br>That was what made the realization of a gigantic footprint on the ground all the worse.<br><br>Adam stared at the indentation for a time, assessing its shape, until he was forced to admit that it was in fact a footprint. One that was bigger and unlike any animal he knew of. Theories bounced around in his head. He thought of ways to make the situation fit his established worldview, like hammering square pegs into a round hole.<br><br>He was so fixated on it that he almost didn't notice when a nearby tree started to rise from the ground. In what could only be described as standing up, the tree pulled its own roots out, dirt flying every which way. Adam stared open-mouthed as the creature walked away with a casual stride. Like this was any other day.<br><br>After seeing <em>that</em>...well, he reached his inevitable conclusion.<br><br>\u201cAh,\u201d he said aloud, to no one in particular. \u201cI'm in a different world.\u201d<br><br>His realization came to him abruptly, yet calmly. The chain of events that had led him here was apparent. He\u2019d been sucked into a painting, spoken with an otherworldly voice, and then dropped from the sky like a comet, somehow emerging unhurt from his fall. It wasn't a dream, or a hallucination, or a government conspiracy, or a prank. Everything could be explained if he accepted the simple fact that he was no longer on Earth.<br><br>If this giant footprint \u2013 larger than six feet wide and tall \u2013 belonged to some kind of supernatural monster, it would frankly make more sense than a conspiracy theory about drugs or an overly-complicated prank. It wasn\u2019t like anyone cared about him enough to go that far for a single prank, anyway. <em>Well, except for Eric.</em><br><br>Maybe he could've still justified the whole thing as some kind of weird, high-tech theme park if he was desperate to cling to a measure of normalcy...but Adam didn\u2019t feel particularly attached to normalcy anymore.<br><br>No, he wouldn't avert his eyes away from the truth. He was in another world \u2013 and just as importantly, he was in danger. It was highly possible that he wouldn't live through the next hour. If more creatures like that walking tree or whatever made the footprint came around, they'd probably rip him to pieces. That was...<br><br><em>Intriguing.</em><br><br>He should have been horrified, nervous, stuttering in a panic. Instead, Adam felt strangely at peace. Sure, he wasn't optimistic about his survival chances, but that was no big deal. Even the urgency of the situation couldn't make him lose his composure.<br><br>Because he was alone.<br><br>Art projects are solitary by nature. Adam hardly ever worked alongside other people. And what little free time he had was spent on a part-time job so he could barely afford the privilege of being in debt. Such was college these days. <em>I could still talk to Eric, but...</em><br><br>He'd gotten used to being alone. So used to it that sometimes he wondered if he\u2019d forgotten how to be human. Without other people around, his emotions felt muted<em>,</em> like a distant echo of what he was <em>supposed</em> to be<em>.</em> Nothing was joyful enough to make him jump up and cheer. Nothing was sad enough to make him cry.<br><br>It was different when he was around people he knew. With them, he felt more...himself. The smiles and cries came more naturally. Unfortunately, he'd gotten less and less of that as time went on. On the rare chance that he did get to see them, it was almost like he was out of practice, putting on an act to simulate what a person should feel. As if being alone was eroding who he <em>was</em>.<br><br>And god knows he had been alone lately.<br><br>Maybe that was why he didn\u2019t feel particularly concerned about the prospect of being in another world and surrounded by monsters. Maybe that was why instead of panicking, he felt something resembling a smile creep onto his face when he saw a creature lurking out from behind a tree.<br><br>\u201cI was right,\u201d Adam muttered, pleased to note there was still delight in his voice. He examined the monster with clinical interest as it began to approach. \u201cYou\u2019re not the thing that made this footprint though, are you?\u201d<br><br>This one seemed too small. It was closer to a lion \u2013 at least in size. Its shape was bizarre, having an elongated middle that stretched on for at least two meters, like someone had started to draw a lion and copy-pasted the torso many times over. Where its eyes and mouth should have been, there were <em>gaps</em>, vacant holes that Adam could see through entirely, images of foliage poking out from behind.<br><br>Every inch of its body felt like it was oscillating in the wind, closer to ink than flesh, distorting itself away from the creature and then forcing itself back into place. Like a displaced polygon having its mistaken movement undone, then redone all over again, endlessly. The creature was blacker than black, less a color and more the absence of light, so dark it reminded Adam of the time he\u2019d worked with that facsimile of Black 3.0. When it snarled, its skin ripped open into a wound, healing when it closed \u2013 before tearing again for another pained scream.<br><br>It was so ugly, monstrous, and a stain on reality itself. Even looking at it felt dangerous. Sweat began running down Adam's brow just from the pressure of maintaining eye contact. His legs trembled, his stomach threatened to empty itself, and he thought:<br><br><em>Hmm. Wonder how I would draw it.</em><br><br>For half a moment, he considered climbing up a tree to get a better view. That would let him depict the monster as accurately as possible. New sights like these didn't come around often.<br><br>Then he felt his shoulder <em>burn</em>, as if it had been bitten by jaws made of acid.<br><br>He stared at the open wound with a sort of numb confusion. The creature hadn\u2019t approached him yet. There hadn\u2019t been, there <em>couldn\u2019t</em> have been a bite of any sort. It was still too far away.<br><br>That was when Adam noticed the ground around the monster. As it stood, flickering inked polygons occasionally fell from its skin, altering whatever grass it touched.<em> Corrupt </em>was the first word that jumped to mind, although <em>stain</em> was probably more accurate. The contaminated grass didn\u2019t just blacken; it appeared to lose its detail, changing its shape into a blob that only vaguely resembled what it had once had been. Each blade of grass still pointed outward, but even the thinnest green was now a blacker-than-black wide polygon, flickering skyward.<br><br>\"Ah,\u201d he remarked. \u201cNot good.\u201d<br><br>The monster snarled, stepping closer. Adam felt that horrible burning feeling again \u2013 this time on his stomach \u2013 and finally understood what was happening. Whenever the creature ripped its own skin to open a new mouth, more of its flickering flesh exploded forward like a projectile. The attack was incredibly fast; he could only see it now that the beast was growing closer to him.<br><br><em>Have to go.</em> Adam dashed to the side. He only made it several feet before the monster howled. Two more bursts of flickering inked flesh hit him, this time on both of his legs. He tried to run, but his legs merely trembled once before giving in. It was as if the energy had been completely drained from them.<br><br>As he fell, he tightly clutched his backpack to prevent his tablet from being damaged. Adam breathed a sigh of relief when his back collided with a thick tree trunk. His tablet was safe, and this way, he could face the monster sitting down rather than laying in the dirt.<br><br><em>Doesn\u2019t look like I can walk anymore, </em>he thought, far too calmly. Distantly, he realized that he hadn't screamed. Odd. Making noise when injured was supposed to be a primal reflex, wasn\u2019t it? <em>Oh, well. At least I can face my end with dignity.</em><br><br>His grim acceptance was undercut by how annoyingly <em>slow </em>the monster chose to approach. It had immobilized his left shoulder, torso, and both legs \u2013 and now seemed content to stalk at him like it had all the time in the world. At no point did it appear in a hurry. If anything, the creature had slowed its gait since.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Was it afraid that Adam could still escape somehow? No...that didn\u2019t seem right. It almost seemed like it was enjoying, <em>feeding</em> on his fear.<br><br>Well, good luck with that. Adam intended on making it a poor meal if nothing else.<br><br>\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cI can't walk. If I try to crawl, it'll shoot and kill me. That\u2019s a problem. Hmmmm.\u201d<br><br>He considered trying to kill it. Fight it. Hurt it? Frankly, even that much was impossible. His backpack contained a broken phone, a drawing tablet, and some books. Nothing that could injure an otherworldly abomination.<br><br>\u201cShould I try crawling for the hell of it?\u201d The idea was...unpalatable, like being force-fed expired meat. Adam hardly wanted to die, but the notion of pathetically squirming in the dirt like a worm was somehow less appealing. There was a difference between clinging to life and wasting the little time he had remaining.<br><br>If he had no chance of escaping, he would rather use his last few minutes doing what he loved.<br><br>Adam picked up his drawing tablet. <em>I might be dying, but at least this still works</em>. There was always a bright spot somewhere. <em>I can\u2019t draw anything too complex. Don\u2019t think this thing will give me the opportunity.</em><br><br>He looked ahead. The monster was approaching him agonizingly slowly, but it <em>was</em> indeed getting closer to him. Adam considered screaming for help, before noticing that the wound on his torso had eaten into his vocal cords, making it difficult to speak. <em>Guess that\u2019s just how it is. But at the very least...at the very least, I can draw.<br><br>One more time.<br><br>I\u2019ll put my <strong>soul </strong>into this sketch.</em><br><br>It was funny. A few hours ago, he'd felt despondent over losing the contest. Without that prize money, Adam wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford rent, let alone his college tuition. His future prospects were either taking on crippling loans, or being evicted and expelled. At the time, he'd perhaps been a tad melodramatic, thinking things like: <em>Eric winning that contest may as well have killed him.</em><br><br>Now it all seemed rather literal. If he hadn\u2019t lost the contest, he wouldn\u2019t have wandered into the old man\u2019s shop. He wouldn\u2019t have gotten sucked into that painting. He wouldn't have been transported to a different world \u2013 only to be killed by a monster merely five minutes later.<br><br>There was some poetry in that, Adam thought, even if he wasn\u2019t talented enough with words to fully express it. Somehow, that notion made his impending death less painful.<br><br>Against his own nature, he let out a low peal of laughter, his ruined voice warbling as it echoed through the treetop canopy. Everything just seemed so amusing right now. Maybe the blood loss was getting to him.<br><br>\u201cYou know, monster...\u201d he began, in a rasping tone. \u201cArt is a complicated thing. Getting good at it isn't just about how skilled you are. Despite how professors ramble on about the art speaking for itself, CONTEXT really fucking matters. It sets expectations. An amazing artist can provide context with just his art and the title, but even if they<em> aren\u2019t</em> good, it might not matter. If the story surrounding their art is big enough, then that can elevate a piss-poor painting into something better. Something special. Get what I mean?\u201d<br><br>The monster didn\u2019t reply. If it had more intelligence than an animal, it certainly wasn\u2019t showing it. Adam didn\u2019t care, continuing to talk as he loaded up his favorite program and created a new layer. At least it was loading fast enough.<br><br>\u201cEven a mediocre painting can become a masterpiece if it depicts the thing that killed its artist. People would pay millions for that. So you know...you just might make me famous after I die.\u201d<br><br>After a moment of searching, he managed to find his pen. Adam gingerly placed his tablet on his legs, relieved to find that there was enough strength left in them to use as a support.<br><br>\u201cSo in a way, I have to thank you. Even if I would\u2019ve preferred to be a shit artist who lived a long life, I\u2019ll take the next-best thing.\u201d<br><br>Adam had thought about the topic sometimes. Every time he struggled to sleep, he\u2019d wondered what his final art piece would be like. Would it be something he drew <em>knowing</em> it was his final piece? Or would it be a mundane object he sketched before suddenly passing away in his sleep from eating so much cheap, preservative-laden crap? It might even be something insignificant he made before giving up on his dreams and getting a real job.<br><br>He\u2019d always hoped for the first option. That way he could burn his life into the canvas, leave his very soul there, like a star athlete\u2019s sendoff game. If he knew he was drawing his last piece, he would work on it for months, tirelessly aiming for a perfection he could never achieve during the span of his lifetime.<br><br><em>Looks like I\u2019m not getting that either, </em>Adam bitterly thought. <em>I\u2019ll go out with a rough sketch of a monster that refuses to sit still. </em>It was difficult to draw something that kept moving closer. The perspective changed too much, which was especially frustrating when dealing with a creature he'd never seen before.<br><br>There were benefits to that, though. Adam could make out more details with each step it took. One thing that stood out to him was how the monster\u2019s skin looked closer to a liquid than a solid, snapping into a frozen state when it appeared ready to attack. Constantly undulating, shifting, changing.<br><br><em>Interesting. Now how am I supposed to capture that with a quick sketch? You\u2019re really not making this easy on me, huh? </em>He smiled at the faceless monster, who \u2013 even without an expression \u2013 seemed to grow furious as it approached. Every few steps, the beast would split open its head-mouth, regurgitating more sharpened flesh at Adam. The attack hurt like a bitch, but none of it hit his drawing arm, so he could take it.<br><br>As he drew, Adam struggled to get a bead on the creature\u2019s behavior. It should be able to kill him at any moment, and yet it refused to. Was it cautious? Or was it trying to make him afraid?<br><br>Somehow, Adam thought it was the latter. This <em>thing</em> wanted to scare him the same way a normal animal would have craved nourishment. \u201cAm I supposed to go down cowering in fear?\u201d he said, in a weak voice. \u201cAm I supposed to die full of regrets? Is that what you want, monster?\"<br><br>His smile deepened. \"Then I\u2019ll make sure to die laughing at you.\u201d<br><br>It was nearly upon him. How much time had passed? Three minutes? Thirty? Didn\u2019t matter. Adam had finished a rough outline of the creature, but hadn\u2019t yet managed to capture its liquid nature. He was out of time. On a whim, he increased the size of his brush on his program, lowered the opacity, and swiped the brush across the screen on a lower layer. <em>Yeah. This will do. </em>He was almost finished.<br><br>But not just yet.<br><br>The monster snarled. This time, when it opened its mouth, it didn\u2019t stop. The gap continued to widen until its entire head was erased, and the monster\u2019s neck now formed his new jaws. A moment later, its entire body was gone, replaced by a gigantic gap in reality, a darker pigment than any color in existence, floating toward Adam and threatening to swallow him whole.<br><br>\u201cA drawing like this isn\u2019t complete without a title,\u201d he muttered, saving the file. \u201cIt needs a name to help give context. I\u2019m not so good that it can stand on its own, you know?\u201d<br><br>Adam gave a wry smile, as if the monster understood him, and pressed the save button for the last time. He\u2019d picked a good name. Adam didn\u2019t want anyone who found his tablet to think that he\u2019d died afraid. Somehow, his quiet pride in his stubborn serenity demanded to be recognized. And thus he named it\u2014<br><br><em><strong>The Painter\u2019s Last Stand</strong></em><br><br>\u201cI\u2019m satisfied,\u201d he said, drawing a deep breath and putting his tablet aside. \u201cHave at it, monster. Hope you choke on my corpse.\u201d<br><br>The monster\u2019s vague, shapeless self leaped into the air and twisted into a different shape\u2014then another\u2014then another\u2014shifting back and forth as if a wave had been sent through it. The creature itself remained frozen midair, unwilling...no, <em>unable</em> to touch Adam. It started to move backward, an invisible force pushing it away, until it suddenly transformed into an impossibly long form thinner than a pencil.<br><br>Then, without warning, it leaped towards Adam. He winced in preparation, but no impact ever came.<br><br>Instead, the creature flew at his tablet.<br><br>\u201cNo!\u201d he cried out. \u201cGoddamn it, don\u2019t you dare break it\u2014that\u2019s my last drawing, that\u2019s\u2014!\u201d<br><br>The creature\u2019s thin, liquid flesh shifted into a concentrated dark gas. With a final shriek, its form clashed against the glass screen, disappearing. A moment later, it was as if it had never been there in the first place.<br><br>All remained still. Adam was alone once again.<br><br>Which wasn\u2019t an improvement, honestly. He was still going to die from his wounds, except now his tablet was broken and no one would see his last piece. Hoping against hope, he grabbed the tablet with careful hands. Maybe its internal hard drive was intact, even if the screen was\u2014<br><br>The screen wasn\u2019t broken.<br><br>Upon further inspection, Adam discovered that his tablet was fully functional. He leaned forward to examine it. Everything appeared fine, but his drawing...there was a layer he didn\u2019t remember adding there before. It was a text layer, hidden beneath the sketch.<br><br><strong>THE PAINTER\u2019S LAST STAND<br>VICTIM: Stained Beast<br>PLAGIARIZED:</strong><br><em><strong>\u2014 </strong>Stained Ink<br><br></em>He barely had time to process that before everything started to <em>change</em>.<br><br>The blood that was flowing freely from his wounds halted, then reversed, slithering back into his body like liquid red snakes. Rather than feeling strange or uncomfortable, the sensation was actually soothing. Flesh knit together, and pain receded. He could feel his strength returning to him with every passing second.<br><br>Yet that wasn\u2019t the strangest thing that happened. As Adam watched, he realized that his blood had turned darker at one point. It wasn\u2019t a shade of red anymore; rather, it was a pitch-black substance that didn\u2019t feel anything like it was before. Something different, but also\u2026familiar.<br><br>Then, he realized it.<br><br>Ink. His blood had become ink.</p>\n            </div>",

My eyes darted, trying to find the best path for me to take, but at that moment, I heard the breathing of the best behind me on my neck, and the explosion of wood. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">My heart skipped a beat as I immediately swerved in a different direction, nearly tripping. Why was it so relentless\u2014 I heard the roars of hatred coming for me\u2014 </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Where had the wolf even come from? </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It appeared mid-air! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I ran from the beast as it tore through the forest\u2014</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI\u2019m going to die\u2060\u2014\u201d There was no other way about it.

My mind spun\u2060\u2014 </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Show resolve or die? </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Was there no other option? I heard the wolf chasing after me, it was an impossible situation, but now\u2060\u2014 now I had a weapon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I hesitated, but I still reached out for the spear as I held it in my hand. I didn\u2019t want to die, I didn\u2019t want to fight either, but running wasn\u2019t getting anywhere, and the more I ran the more tired I felt. I didn\u2019t want to fight, but I literally had no other choice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Gritting my teeth, I spun around to face the wolf, only to see it already jumping towards me\u2060\u2014 I raised my spear, almost by instinct as I thrust into the jumping beast. The black blade of the weapon pierced the shoulder of the wolf as it squealed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The weight of the monster made my arms tremble as I somehow sent the massive white wolf onto the ground, shrieking in pain. I didn\u2019t understand how I had enough strength to do so, how I still had breath even after running for so long, but it didn\u2019t matter now. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I drew back my spear as adrenaline pumped through my veins, immediately driving the weapon into the wolf\u2019s neck. Somehow managing to pull it back before dodging the claws of my adversary, driven by nothing by instincts I side-stepped yet again as I stabbed forward\u2060\u2014</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Arctic Wolf shrieked as its crimson blood splattered, and at that moment another screen flashed. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>[ You have defeated: Arctic Wolf.

I turned and\u2060\u2014 more flashes of light appeared around me. All spawning new enemies into the world, the same kind of hate-driven beast I had just killed\u2060\u2014 </span></p>\n<p><strong>[Arctic Wolf. Tier. F] </strong></p>\n<p><strong>[Arctic Wolf. Tier.

They had practically come from thin air, the same kind of hate-driven beasts as the one I had just killed. Except, there were </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">dozens</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> instead of one. </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Was this what it meant by Intensity\u2060\u2014 </span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And they growled as they immediately took notice of me. My mind spun as I immediately turned around gripping my spear in fear. I couldn\u2019t fight so many at once. There were far too many of them, if they caught up to me I would be done for. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">My heart raced as I jumped over a dead tree, the growls of the numerous Arctic Wolves resounded in my ears as I made my attempt to escape. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The forest in my surroundings blurred as I quickly exited it, with the wolves following closely behind me. Rabid and full of hatred. I ran for my life as the symphony of death chased after me. There had to be something. </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A way to escape\u2060\u2014 </span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And my eyes saw a rock formation in the distance, one that resembled a cave. It was far away, and it wasn\u2019t a guaranteed way to escape, but the snarls behind me kept me from thinking as I focused on running. I just had to escape\u2060\u2014</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I was tackled, rolling through the snow as I tussled with an Arctic Wolf. My heart raced\u2060\u2014</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cFuck off, get away\u2060\u2014 fuck\u2060\u2014\u201d I cursed slamming and kicking it. My spear stabbed into its shoulder as I managed to kick it away. \u201cGah\u2060\u2014\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It scratched my leg as I finally managed to kick it away. I scrambled making distance between me and the wolf\u2060\u2060\u2014 and another wolf tackled me as I hit the cold hard ground with a grunt. It went directly for my neck as I raised my spear and made it bite into its shaft. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Arctic Wolf pressed down as I struggled to fight with its strength. The growls rushed as I rolled with the wolf, finally managing to break its grip and drawing back my spear before stabbing it in its direction. Nicking its leg as it snarled, and at that moment, by sheer instinct, I side-stepped as a wolf narrowly missed me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I backed off only to hear growls behind me, and that\u2019s when I realized, I was surrounded\u2060.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fuck\u2060\u2014 </span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A deep bellow shook the land as my heart instinctively felt primal fear\u2060\u2014 </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">what was that\u2060\u2014 </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and the land </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">shook.</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Trees inside the forest fell, as a shadow towered over the sky. Almost every single wolf in unison shivered as they all turned, and at that moment I saw it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">An impossibly large being of white fur and animal features, imposing with red lights for eyes\u2060\u2014 </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And it stepped forward as its step seemed to dwarf the land, immediately slamming down\u2060\u2014 blood and entrails, snow and dirt exploded as two wolves not too far away from me were stomped out of existence in just a single moment. </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What is\u2060\u2014</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>[The Overlord: Tier: ???] </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And another screen flashed. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>[ The final opponent of training, training will come to an end once The Overlord has been defeated. ] </strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I had no time to even try and understand what the screen just said as It stomped once more, killing another wolf in an instant. Snarls and growls drew me back to reality as I turned around and ran. All of the Arctic Wolves in my surroundings shrieked as they spread in multiple directions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I ran in the direction of the cave as all the wolves spread out, panic blaring through the atmosphere as my mind blared warnings in all directions. I ran with all I had, the panicked shrieks in my surroundings echoed as I rapidly closed in towards the cave. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, I was not alone as another Arctic Wolf chased after me, its ragged and desperate breath sent shivers down my spine, as it sped up before it\u2060\u2014 jumped. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I ducked, barely avoiding its tackle as it landed with a burst of snow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Arctic Wolf immediately turned to attack me once more, frenzied and panicked, its fur standing on end as it took a step towards me\u2014 and it exploded. An icicle of ice appeared along with an explosion of snow as I heard the roars of the Overlord in the distance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I craned my head only to see a silhouette with flashes of lights moving, hearing distant slaughter\u2060\u2014</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">My heart skipped as I turned around and ran towards the cave. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Those few seconds were grueling, seared into my mind as I was terrified beyond reasonable belief. But eventually, I made it inside before going down the ice ravine it was connected to, once I heard calm, that was when I finally relaxed. </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I was\u2026 safe. </span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I stared at my shaking hands, at the spear lying next to me, and there was only one thought in my mind after all of that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWhat the fuck is going on\u2026\u201d I stared at the icy ceiling. \u201cI was just doing fucking </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">anatomy </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">practice out of all things, and now I am in this frozen hell\u2060\u2014 what even is the System anyway?!

It was three against one, my mind whirled, panicking for answers as I somehow dodged and ducked between the attacks\u2060\u2014 </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I had to use the skill\u2060. </span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Otherwise, I was going to die\u2060\u2014</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And a wolf pounced as I prepared the spear, this time following the familiar motions\u2060 as </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">something </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">inside of me engaged, my arm muscles tensing\u2060\u2014 </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[Frenzied Whirlwind]\u2060\u2014 </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I stabbed multiple times forward in an instant, piercing through the torso of the wolf numerous times as a screen flashed. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>[ You have defeated: Arctic Wolf.

Meanwhile, the last remaining Arctic Wolf pounced on me as I attempted to dodge, but I was sluggish as it managed to slash at my arm, drawing a grunt from me. </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Just once more\u2060\u2014 </span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">My body was screaming at me to stop, and yet I raised my spear anyway, ignoring all protests. If I stopped now, there would be no tomorrow; there would be no </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">nothing. </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The wolf snarled as I prepared my spear and it rushed\u2060\u2014</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[Frenzied Whirlwind\u2060]\u2014</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I stabbed thrice onto the wolf before the skill ended from pure exhaustion.

After, a long sigh of relief hit me. Despite everything that had happened, I was still very much alive. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">My mind wandered back to the initial chase, the confusion I felt upon getting to this frozen land, and finally, at the Overlord\u2060\u2014 </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The final opponent of training. </span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I still didn\u2019t understand what the System was, or if I could even return home, but right now, there was a simple resolve in my mind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I\u2019m going to kill the Overlord. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Slowly, I stood up and reached for the spear impaled on the Arctic Wolf, drawing it from its body with a splatter of blood. </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I\u2019m going to live no matter what. <br></span></em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><strong><em>Author Notes:</em></strong></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thanks you all for reading!

        "chapter_content": "<div class=\"chapter-inner chapter-content\">\n                <p>The 7/11 chime played and the automatic doors started closing behind me. In my hand was a plastic bag with a bottle of lemon tea, a salmon onigiri, and a lukewarm nikuman. Already the flimsy handles of the bag were digging into my skin.</p>\n<p>It was late spring and the air had started warming significantly over the last few days. It was sure to be another sweltering summer this year.</p>\n<p>The clap of my sandals against the heels of my feet followed me as I walked up the slope to the street where my house lay. In hindsight, it was still a bit too cold for sandals and bare feet, but I\u2019d been too lazy to put on proper shoes when I left the house, after all, I was only going to be out for a few minutes before I went back to studying.</p>\n<p>Although I\u2019d failed this year\u2019s entrance exam, I was determined to study enough that I would ace it next January. Still, that was such a long way away.</p>\n<p>I sighed as I pulled open my house door. I\u2019d promised mom that I\u2019d get into a good university, but look where that\u2019d gotten me. Now I was a R\u014dnin, left to wander the streets of Ky\u014dto until next year, while all my high school friends were having fun with their new classmates.</p>\n<p><em>How long before they forget me?</em></p>\n<p>I pushed the thought from my mind and hung my windbreaker by the door. The plastic bag with my lunch I placed on top of the console table next to the coatrack. It was ugly and its colour didn\u2019t match the walls whatsoever, but mom loved that thing and refused to throw it out.</p>\n<p>Before I could take my sandals off, there came a knock from the door.</p>\n<p><em>That\u2019s odd</em>, I thought. I hadn\u2019t seen anyone else outside on the street.</p>\n<p>I opened the door and looked outside, but there was no one there.</p>\n<p>As I stepped through the doorway to check, I felt my stomach shoot up into my throat as though I suddenly fell through the ground and my vision flickered black several times.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A buffet of summer-warm wind ruffled my hair and I opened my eyes to my surroundings. The street outside my house was gone, its asphalt road and houses replaced with trampled dirt and a bustling marketplace.</p>\n<p>Next to me, a woman yelped in alarm and I turned to look, realising quickly that I\u2019d been the cause of her fright.</p>\n<p><em>I suppose that makes sense. I did after all just suddenly appear next to her.</em></p>\n<p>As I looked around, walking a bit aimlessly back-and-forth between the many market stalls, I felt as though I\u2019d stepped through a wormhole to a different time and place. The people near me, all of whom were staring curiously at me I might add, looked distinctly European in their features and wore what could only be described as medieval peasant clothes.</p>\n<p>I had to grab my head to stop my mind from reeling.</p>\n<p><em>Am I having a really strange dream right now? Or maybe I\u2019m hallucinating?</em></p>\n<p>It was not yet warm enough for a heatstroke, but maybe this was the side-effect of not hydrating properly?</p>\n<p>I pinched my cheek as hard as I could.</p>\n<p>\u201cOw.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Okay\u2026 not a dream. </em></p>\n<p>I crouched and scooped a handful of dirt from the ground, moving it around with my fingers. It felt very real, so hallucination was probably out of the picture too.</p>\n<p>Not knowing what else to do, I walked up to one of the stalls. A blonde and tan trinket vendor with sausage fingers covered in rings stared up at me from where he sat.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me? Where am I?\u201d</p>\n<p>He looked at me like I was stupid, then sighed and said, in perfect Japanese with the same Kansai dialect as me, \u201cThis is the city of Lundia. It sits eighty leagues inland from the port of Ochre.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I replied and walked away from his spread of jewels, rings, and timepieces. I had no idea what a league was nor why he was perfectly comprehensible to me, despite clearly being of a different nationality.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After walking around the marketplace for fifteen minutes or more, I found a guardsman who was clad in polished platemail and hugged a tall lance. He was standing guard outside a building that might have been a bank or luxury store.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I started, but before I had a chance to ask my question, he took one look at my clothes and replied:</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Adventurers\u2019 Guild is down <em>that</em> street and to the left, you can\u2019t miss it.\u201d</p>\n<p>I followed the direction he pointed with his left hand and nodded my thanks before going that way.</p>\n<p><em>I have no idea what I\u2019m doing here, but maybe this Guild can help me?</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Adventurers\u2019 Guild was indeed quite easy to spot, as it towered over the nearby one-storey buildings and was built not of wood, but rather of stone, with green shingles on its roof. Its crimson wooden doors were flung wide open and there seemed quite a throng of people within.</p>\n<p>After entering, I saw that half the place was like a tavern, with people drinking and eating around circular tables. Many of the people within, Adventurers I guessed, were dressed in elaborate flowing robes or brutal-looking armour, with their weapons of choice leaning against their chairs or strapped to their waists. Some of them turned and snickered when they saw me enter, but most seemed to purposefully ignore my arrival.</p>\n<p>What struck me the most, however, was not their clothes nor weapons, but rather that many of them looked just as out of place as me, with their features showing more than just the European features I\u2019d seen in all the people about town.</p>\n<p><em>Maybe they\u2019re like me?</em> I thought hopefully.</p>\n<p>I walked up to the nearest person: a tall musclebound black man dressed in spike-covered leather armour who was leaning against one of the wooden pillars that supported the tall ceiling to the first floor. His palms were both placed on the pommels of two shortswords that hung from each hip.</p>\n<p>Before I could utter a single word, he pointed to a queue of about eight people on the other side of the floor, \u201cNewcomers have to register.\u201d</p>\n<p>Puzzled, but assuming this was the way to get answers, I got into the line of people. At the front, a desk with a kind-looking woman dressed in a green blouse and skirt with blonde twin-tails was greeting the people and having them place their hands on a strange glyph-covered black-grey slate. The glyphs glowed a strange frost-blue.</p>\n<p>After about twenty minutes, when my legs were starting to get sore from standing, I got to the front of the line.</p>\n<p>\u201cName, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy name is Temaru Ry\u016bta. I was hoping you could\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you spell that?\u201d she interrupted.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, erm, my family-name is the sign for Hand and Circle, with my given-name being the sign for Willow and the one for Fat.\u201d</p>\n<p>She looked at me, confused, then showed me what she\u2019d written on her scroll. She was writing in romaji.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm, I think it\u2019s T-E-M-A-R-U R-Y-U-U-T-A in Roman lettering.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you. My name is Caroline, and I will be performing your Adventurer Role Assignment today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy <em>what</em>? I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on or why I\u2019m here. Or where \u2018here\u2019 is for that matter\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>She nodded, as if this wasn\u2019t news to her. As if my situation here was commonplace\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cI am unfamiliar with the World you are from, but you are currently in Mondus, specifically the western continent of Hallem. This city is called Lundia and is part of the Principality of Arley.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it\u2026 common for people like me to be here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Caroline nodded solemnly. \u201cNo one knows why, but Otherworlders like yourself appear in Lundia quite frequently. It has actually become the backbone of the Adventurer industry, as most commonfolk would never take on such jobs as what we offer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do I get back home? I don\u2019t want to be here\u2026 my family will be worried!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand this is hard to digest, Temaru-san, but there is no way for you to return to your world. My best advice would be to take the Role Assignment and try to make a living in Lundia for a while doing quests for the Guild. Hallem is a fantastic place for explorers and travellers, and many who were in your situation have found a new life here and even seem to thrive.\u201d</p>\n<p>I was trying my best not to panic, while parts of my brain were still locked firmly to the belief that I was dreaming. In the end, as the next person in line voiced their frustrations at the delay, I caved in and told her, \u201cI\u2019ll take the Role Assignment.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d</p>\n<p>Caroline brought out the slate I\u2019d seen earlier and bade me place my hand on it. Its black stone was frigid to the touch and the glowing sigils seemed to throb gently as I put my clammy hand on its surface.</p>\n<p>I held my hand on it for what might have been a moment, but which felt like hours, especially considering how I got the sense that everyone was staring at me and awaiting the result. As the slate\u2019s glyphs started blinking, she had me lift my hand, before, somehow, interpreting the response of the tablet. It seemed to make as much sense as reading the stains left by tea in a cup to me, but she apparently understood how to read it, because she announced, louder than I felt necessary:</p>\n<p>\u201cExorcist.\u201d</p>\n<p>I had half a second to think \u201cOh man that sounds super cool!\u201d, but then I noticed the responses of the crowded tavern and nearby observers. Some laughed, a few sighed disappointed, but most seemed to just instantly lose interest.</p>\n<p>Before I could ask what my Adventurer Role was good for, she handed me a credit-card-sized stone tablet of the same nature as the tablet. Rather than esoteric symbols I had no way of deciphering, the card was covered in legible symbols. I once again had to wonder why everyone spoke Japanese and why the card was covered in Japanese text, when they clearly did not use the language.</p>\n<p>Caroline cleared her throat and told me, \u201cThis is your Adventurers\u2019 Guild Card. Your first one is free, but, if you lose it, a replacement will cost three gold crowns. You can use this card to see your Status, Abilities, and Guild Rank. Make sure to always keep this on you, because it\u2019s required when accepting and turning in quests.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, because I didn\u2019t know what else to respond. Things were already completely beyond my control. \u201cErm, how am I supposed to learn about my Role, this world, and, you know\u2026 everything?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand that you must have a lot of questions, Temaru-san. You can learn the answers to many of them by speaking to the Genius in the library on the second floor or from your fellow Adventurers. I would also recommend looking at what kind of groups have openings for new members, although\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlthough?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say this, but your assigned Role is very specialised and does not have a lot of synergy in groups. It\u2019s generally a solo Role that takes on very difficult quests which no other Roles are capable of dealing with.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d I almost blurted out, but instead I managed to keep my calm and simply asked, \u201cCan I change my Role then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnfortunately, that is not a possibility. Although if you make it to a higher rank you will be able to specialise in an Advanced Role with more group utility.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026If?\u201d</p>\n<p>Caroline suddenly blushed, realising she had let that one slip in.</p>\n<p><em>Great\u2026 Not only am I in a completely foreign land with apparently no way of getting home, but I had the misfortune of being assigned a Role that sounds like a death sentence\u2026</em></p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for your help,\u201d I told her. She was not to blame for my circumstances, so I couldn\u2019t exactly fault her for it.</p>\n<p>I finally took the Guild Card from her hands, before leaving the line. There weren\u2019t a lot of people waiting in the queue for registration, but it had definitely grown while I was at the front of it, which made me feel rather guilty and embarrassed.</p>\n<p>As I moved closer to the tavern section of the Guild Hall, where large boards were plastered with quest scrolls of varying types, as well as group posters, I looked down at the card in my hand and saw how I had been reduced to a bunch of very clinical estimates:</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto\" src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1125155811346366474/1125158553896894574/Ryuutas_Adventurer_Card_chapter_1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"647\" height=\"400\"></p>\n<p><em>Two E\u2019s and F\u2019s\u2026</em></p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t really know what each of the eight attributes represented, but I guessed that my Role was determined from all of these combined. Considering the brief description of the sort of jobs I could expect, maybe an F-rating in Luck was mandatory to become an Exorcist?</p>\n<p>The E in Strength and Dexterity seemed pretty accurate to my real-life physical condition, as I had been one of the slowest and weakest boys in my high school class. As for Vitality, I had no idea what <em>that</em> represented, though it could possibly be my physical endurance, given that I tired easily from just a brisk jog.</p>\n<p>Soul, Pact, and Acumen were not immediately clear to me. I had never been much of a gamer, so while I could recognise some game elements from this place and setting, my understanding was so shallow that I had no idea if it applied here nor how it could be applied\u2026</p>\n<p><em>Renji would\u2019ve known what to do if he was here\u2026</em> I complained internally. He had always been the smartest of my friends, somehow managing to attain the highest grades in every field, while also maintaining an all-consuming Gaming Otaku lifestyle. I\u2019d watched him play hundreds of games, and listened to his long expos\u00e9s of how to do <em>this</em> and how to do <em>that</em>, though now I wish I\u2019d been paying more attention, as it was clear that his wisdom had been wasted on me.</p>\n<p>I bit my lower lip in consternation. My string of misfortune had only continued, even though I had done my best to improve. Failing to get into university had been a wake-up call for me to take life more seriously and do something about my many shortcomings. I had even managed to build up the courage to confess to my high school classmate Inoue Kumi, who, instead of flat-out rejecting me, had said she would think about it and let me know her answer during the summer, though now I would never hear what answer she had.</p>\n<p>While I seared the image of the colourful little graph that was supposed to represent me as a person into my retinas, I felt an overwhelming wave of despondency settle on me like a weighted blanket.</p>\n<p><em>What will mom say when she gets home and sees I\u2019m no longer there? Will she be relieved that her failure of a son is gone? Or will she be sad and report me missing?</em></p>\n<p>Given how our last argument had gone, I couldn\u2019t truly say I knew. I still remembered her accusations that I had wasted all the money she had spent on getting me into a private high school and prestigious cram schools. I had never wanted to be a doctor like she desired of me and perhaps, as a kind of rebellion against her will, I had failed the entrance exam intentionally. I hadn\u2019t been a bad student in high school, so perhaps my failure was a deliberate self-sabotage that I could never admit to myself?</p>\n<p>The last time I had seen Renji before the summer, he had clapped me on the back and told me things were going to be alright. I had honestly believed him.</p>\n<p><em>\u2026but look at me now.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After shouldering my way to the Quest Boards and perusing the options for a while, I found a quest for an Exorcist of Novitiate Rank like me. From looking at the many other quests, I knew that those that asked for a specific Adventurer Role were extremely rare, and, besides Exorcist, the only other ones I saw on display were Priest and Hunter, the former for its apparent ability to \u2018heal\u2019, and the latter for its tracking and animal handling. I had also gathered that, besides the Rank requirement, each quest had a difficulty/complexity scale, which ranged from Simple to Perilous. Unsurprisingly, the only Exorcist Quest on offer was ranked the highest difficulty\u2026</p>\n<p>If I were to actually take a quest from the board, I knew I\u2019d go with the Simple-rated Gathering or Delivery types, which, although not having much of a reward, at least offered a steady income, although I didn\u2019t really understand the currency here nor its value. Granted, if I were to actually take the Exorcism Quest and complete it, the reward was one gold and forty silver crowns, while the Simple everyone-can-do-it types only offered a few dozen copper crowns.</p>\n<p>I seriously doubted I\u2019d commit to the dangerous Adventurers\u2019 Guild work though, and besides, no one had said I couldn\u2019t just find a job in the town of Lundia. After all, I was okay with my hands when it came to repairing electronics and making things, plus I had some experience from my part-time job at a Yakitori restaurant, so I could make some simple meals and wait on customers.</p>\n<p>Before really deciding on what I\u2019d do, I wanted to speak to the \u2018Genius\u2019 on the second floor. I had yet to talk to any of the established Adventurers that lounged in the tavern and near the Quest Boards, but I was hardly the only Novitiate that found them imposing and intimidating. Although, when a person was announced as having the Priest Role, many of the lounging Adventurers had swarmed the guy, eager to acquire him for their group. Even Roles like Vanguard, Brawler, Ranger, and Spellhand had all found modest interest from groups. Unsurprisingly, female Novitiates were all given a lot of attention, which made me wonder how the mass of Adventurers would react to a Girl Exorcist.</p>\n<p>As I began climbing the staircase to the next floor, I realised how ridiculous I must look, given how I was still wearing my sandals, as well as comfortable pyjama-esque pants and a threadbare t-shirt with a panda print on the front that said \u201c<em>I hate morning people</em>\u201d in English text. I doubted my bedhead hair and sullen eyes were much to write home about either. Not for the first time in my life, I felt envious of Renji, who had somehow gotten the S-tier package deal: he was handsome, smart, funny, and charming. The fact that he had been my friend since middle school was one of my proudest accomplishments, although it had been tough constantly being the go-between for the girls who wanted to ask him out, but I had treasured my friendship with him nonetheless.</p>\n<p>I let out a sigh as I reached the first-floor landing and didn\u2019t pay much attention to the floor before ascending to the second. With every step came the awful slap of the squishy plastic sandals against the soles of my feet. If not for the fact that there was dust, dirt, and errant stones everywhere in the building, I would\u2019ve taken the sandals off. If someone came to this world and brought the invention of the vacuum cleaner with them, they would become an instant billionaire, I was sure. No sooner had the thought hit me than I remembered that I had left my house with my phone and wallet in my pockets.</p>\n<p>Stopping halfway up to the second floor, I began patting down my deep trouser pockets, but found nothing within except my new Card and some balls of lint\u2026</p>\n<p><em>So much for wowing the general populace with my hyper-advanced technology\u2026</em></p>\n<p><em>Then again, if they have magic here, maybe they already have some equivalent to the smartphone?</em> I thought, thinking back to the stone tablet. And I could hardly be the only person here who had the thought of bringing technology with me. Perhaps the people of this world were reticent to change or maybe they just didn\u2019t trust people like me who randomly showed up?</p>\n<p>As I reached the second-floor landing, I was greeted by tall bookcases that created a maze of sorts. Each shelf was half-a-metre deep, as there were as many scrolls packed in as books, but, just looking at it, I highly doubted I was meant to rifle through stuff and find the answers that way. The Guild Representative had mentioned a \u2018Genius\u2019, which I was mostly certain was a title for a person, though, as I began my foray into the bookcase-maze, I started to doubt myself. I began to double back, when I suddenly noticed a path that led deeper into the centre of the floor, and, as I rounded a corner, I entered into an office of sorts.</p>\n<p>Three large desks surrounded a figure sitting cross-legged atop a wooden swivel stool, each of which was piled high with wobbling stacks of books and pyramids of scrolls. The figure was holding one end of a scroll high above his head, while using his free hand to scratch his chin as he studied the contents.</p>\n<p>\u201cErm, pardon the intrusion, but\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>The man moved the hand holding the scroll slightly, so that he could see me. Round thick-lensed spectacles sat atop his nose and his long unkempt dark-grey hair fell down across his face and back. He went barefooted and only wore a lab-coat-esque garment with wide overlong sleeves and deep pockets on the side.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the new Exorcist.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cErm, yes, that\u2019s me. Wait\u2026 how\u2019d you know?\u201d I definitely hadn\u2019t seen this guy in the hall and it seemed like he might have been in this place for days, given that there was something like a sleeping bag on the floor, as well as the leftover dirty trays from at least a dozen meals.</p>\n<p>\u201cI expect you\u2019re looking for answers to your many questions?\u201d he asked, not answering my question.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Genius, or at least I assumed that\u2019s who this guy was, nodded sagely, then said, \u201cYou can\u2019t go home. Yes, you\u2019re stuck with your assigned Role. You could try to find work outside the Guild, but the native population of Lundia despises Adventurers and actively prevent them from finding honest work, meaning you\u2019d no doubt end up in something shady and illegal if you <em>were</em> to find employment.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about my friends and family?\u201d</p>\n<p>The Genius tilted his head slightly, as though not following.</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t people going to question my disappearance from the real world?\u201d</p>\n<p>He replied with a shrug, before adding, \u201cNo one knows, because, you see, none of us can go home to check.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you an Adventurer yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf a sort, I suppose. I was assigned the Role of Librarian, then later specialised as a Genius. It\u2019s a comfy job if you like reading and organising information, but I don\u2019t do a lot of Adventuring.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I see your Guild Card?\u201d</p>\n<p>He squinted slightly suspiciously.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re willing to trade,\u201d he replied. That made me pause. After all, if he destroyed it or decided to not return it, getting a new one issue would take a lot of money. Money that I definitely did not have. But did it really matter either way? I was fairly sure I wouldn\u2019t do any Guild quests.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking that replacing a Guild Card will cost a fortune, but that you don\u2019t mind losing the Card regardless.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes your Genius Role include mind-reading?\u201d</p>\n<p>The man shrugged.</p>\n<p>I ended up handing him my Card and he handed me his in exchange. Before I could even take a look at his Status and Abilities, I heard him chuckle and say, \u201c\u2026Two F-tiers.\u201d</p>\n<p>I couldn\u2019t help but blush. Showing someone else my status was surprisingly embarrassing. After all, it was like giving them a report card of all my grades from my finals exams. I looked down to the Card in my hand and frowned at what I saw.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto\" src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1125155811346366474/1125158552814755891/moss_Adventurer_Card_chapter_1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"649\" height=\"400\"></p>\n<p><em>C in everything except Intelligence, which is S-tier\u2026</em></p>\n<p>\u201cHow come you don\u2019t have a lot of abilities?\u201d I asked. I couldn\u2019t tell if this was the norm or not, but I\u2019d assumed that someone at his Rank would\u2019ve had more. I almost asked what the \u2018Nightmare Feeder\u2019 skill was, but was honestly too scared by the title to ask.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs I say, I stay mostly stay cooped up with my books, but my Librarian Skill Set allows me to create scrolls that mimic other Roles\u2019 abilities, so long as I have the attributes to match. And before you ask, no, I cannot use any Exorcist abilities. They all require an S-tier in Soul.\u201d</p>\n<p>We swapped back Cards and I took a moment to look at my own abilities. Omniglot was self-explanatory, as it simply meant that I could understand all languages, hence why everything sounded and looked like Japanese to me, except for times like when the Guild Representative had written out my name or when I looked at the Genius\u2019 unique name.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does \u2018Exorcist I\u2019 mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEach Role has something like it, but it\u2019s your basic Skill Set that includes the abilities of your Role. To view them, you just have to tap it with your finger and it expands.\u201d</p>\n<p>I did as he said and tapped the ability name, which caused the list to expand and become a continuously-scrolling list, as it was too long to encompass all the elements within the frame of the card. Before I could really get a good look at all the abilities available to me, \u00c6mos continued:</p>\n<p>\u201cSkills come in five levels, and with things like your Role Skill Set, the entire thing will reach level two after you train at least half the abilities within to that level. Think of it as different levels of math, with the first level being simple things like subtraction and addition, and the final being like quantum physics. Some abilities are easier to level than others, but I\u2019ve heard it compared to training certain muscle groups, where some are quick to bulk up and grow stronger with hardly any effort, and others take more concentrated and specific training to accomplish the same results.\u201d</p>\n<p>I nodded slowly. It seemed quite an extreme comparison, but perhaps there was such an extreme difference in the Abilities and their power? After a few cycles of the scrolling text, I had a grasp on the abilities included in \u2018Exorcist I\u2019. They were as follows: <em>Banish</em>; <em>Contain</em> <em>Spirit</em>; <em>Focus</em> <em>Wielder</em>; <em>Hymnal</em>; <em>Investigation</em>; <em>Invoke</em> <em>Ritual</em>; <em>Meditation</em>; <em>Offering</em>; <em>Pact</em> <em>of</em> <em>the</em> <em>Familiar</em>; <em>Possessed</em> <em>Weapon</em> <em>Wielder</em>; <em>Repel</em>;<em> Sanctify</em>; <em>Soul</em> <em>Barrier</em>; <em>Spirit</em> <em>Sight</em>; <em>Staff</em> <em>Wielder</em>; <em>Summon</em>; <em>Ward</em> <em>Crafter</em>; &amp; <em>Worship</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cCould you explain some of the Attributes to me as well? Like, what does Soul, Acumen, and Pact mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>The Genius nodded curtly. \u201cOf course. Soul is the counterpart to Vitality and represents your spiritual endurance and defences, governing how many spells you might use before exhausting yourself and how much resistance you have against spells that affect your spirit and mind directly, such as Possession, Sleep, Madness, and so forth. Some people equate Soul to the term \u2018Mana\u2019, but that excludes the defensive element, which is very important against many of the challenges and monsters Adventurers face. Particularly Exorcists who have to deal with wraiths, demons, and the like.</p>\n<p>\u201cAcumen is something like innate wisdom, but seems to affect accuracy and tinkering as well. A low Acumen is generally seen as impulsive and lacking forethought, as well as being clumsy with spells and ranged weapons. It\u2019s probably the hardest of the Attributes to define, but you don\u2019t have to think too much about it. Pact is one that is however quite easy to define, as it governs your ability to deal with anything like a ritual or summoning, but it also affects how easily you might form bonds with familiars and pets, hence why it is a C-tier requirement for Hunters, who have the ability to tame wild animals.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo the Roles we\u2019re assigned is based on meeting requirements then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs far as we understand it, yes. Amusingly, Exorcist is the only Role I am aware of which requires an F-tier in an Attribute.\u201d</p>\n<p>I frowned. It wasn\u2019t really that amusing to me.</p>\n<p>\u201cListen, Ry\u016bta, this situation that you\u2019re in is definitely bad luck. It\u2019s very few people who would actively wish to be taken away from their world and be faced with perilous quests by an uncaring world that honestly despises them for their very nature. No one knows why all of us are here, nor why only we \u2018Otherworlders\u2019 have access to all <em>these</em> powers, but you\u2019re going to have to accept your new Role. There is no room for mistakes and half-heartedness when it comes to being an Adventurer, especially not with a Role as difficult and complex as yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>I had a grim thought that I blurted out. \u201cWhat\u2019s the mortality rate for Exorcists?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00c6mos didn\u2019t say anything for a moment, surprised by the question. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019d gain anything by me telling you that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d still like to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>He unfolded his legs and rolled-up the scroll in his hand, before adding it to a pyramid stack on one of the desks. As he swivelled back to face me, he said, \u201cFor the first Exorcism Quest, the mortality rate is ninety-six percent. That means only one in twenty-five make it out of their first exorcism alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>My frown deepened. Now I understood the pitying glances I\u2019d gotten and the unsaid warning in Caroline\u2019s voice. \u201cAnd what\u2019s the general mortality rate?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExorcist is the only Role that faces Perilous Quests right off the bat, but if you were to say within the first month of work, which might include Simple Gathering and Delivery, as well as Bounty and Extermination Quests, then it\u2019s about forty percent on average. Those who make it past the first month of being an Adventurer generally only face a twelve percent mortality rate though. There\u2019s a sudden spike when Adventurers reach the \u2018Eminent\u2019 Guild Rank though, since all available quests around that Rank end up \u2018Dangerous\u2019 or higher in difficulty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI see,\u201d was all I could reply. Having my expected lifespan and that of my cohort reduced to simple statistics was a demoralising thing.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn case you were wondering, the Guild Ranks are as follows: Novitiate; Initiate; Seeker; Eminent; Savant; &amp; Master. The deciding factors for going up in Rank is whether or not you are deemed capable of handling the responsibility that each Rank bears within the Guild, as well as how you\u2019d deal with the kinds of quests you\u2019ll face. Given that Exorcists usually always deal with quests of Dangerous or Perilous difficulty, they usually go up in rank quite quickly. In fact, I think it\u2019s almost tradition to receive a promotion to Seeker upon completing your first Exorcism Quest, as it shows overwhelming talent.\u201d</p>\n<p>I nodded lamely. It was already too much information to bear and too much responsibility to deal with. A seventeen-year-old like me wouldn\u2019t have been expected to face such overwhelming adversity in the real world, but here it sounded like people like me who were stolen away from our worlds were just cast directly into the meat-grinder, with those few who came out the other end perhaps finding some purpose in life, though who could say for sure.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat look on your face is one I\u2019ve seen a lot before, but I will give you the same advice that I\u2019ve given all the Exorcists before you: take your time to learn your abilities and rely on easy quests to make a living for a few weeks, before attempting to take on an Exorcism Quest. And also, try to find an established Exorcist to become your mentor.\u201d</p>\n<p>I nodded again, slightly more energy this time, though it was mostly faux. Suddenly a coin was shoved into my right hand. It was cold against my skin. I looked up, realising I\u2019d been staring at my sandalled feet for a while, then I lifted the coin up and saw that it was of a silvery metal and had the engraved letters for \u201cten\u201d on its face, alongside a stylised crown above a half-moon crescent.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m giving you this money out of my own pocket, Ry\u016bta, because I believe that you\u2019ll be able to beat the stats that promise only failure. Use this to find a place to stay for the next week as you settle in. Don\u2019t forget to check out our For-Rent Armoury on the first floor that you no doubt saw coming up here, but keep in mind that your equipment won\u2019t magically make you better than you are. I recommend starting off with just some basic clothes to replace what you\u2019re wearing, as well as a good pair of boots and a backpack of some kind. You\u2019ll end up walking a lot for the Delivery Quests and you\u2019ll need a way to carry stuff for Gathering Quests.\u201d</p>\n<p>I quickly put the coin in my pocket, then looked intently at \u00c6mos, before bowing deeply. \u201cThank you so much! I will aspire to live up to your expectations of me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like this is goodbye or anything. I\u2019m here more often than not, so come back anytime you have questions or\u2026 you know\u2026 if you just feel like talking.\u201d He said the latter with an awkward kind of hesitation, which made me think that he probably rarely got to <em>just</em> <em>talk</em> to people without the expectation of giving answers and advice.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will,\u201d I told him and bowed deeply again, before leaving the maze of bookcases.</p>\n<p>I went down the stairs, not bothering to check the first floor yet, and then left the Guild Hall out the open front doors as well.</p>\n<p>I was greeted by a dark early-evening sky, though was fairly sure it was no more than five in the evening, which made me wonder what kind of night-and-day cycle this continent of Hallem had. Without any reference to the rest of the world of Mondus, it was hard to tell exactly how close I was to either of the two poles of this world, but if it followed the same pattern as Earth, then I assumed I was somewhere semi-tropical, given that it was still quite warm, though not as much as summer-time Ky\u014dto.</p>\n<p>Letting out a sigh, I pushed the pointless speculations from my mind and began looking for a place I could stay for the night and get a meal for my growling stomach.</p>\n            </div>",
